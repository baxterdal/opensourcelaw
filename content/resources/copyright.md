summary: Frequently asked questions regarding copyright relevant to open casebooks.
---

*These frequently asked questions are not intended as, and are not a substitute for, legal advice. Since much of this information is about online sources which are frequently updated and changed, you're encouraged to refer to the original source referenced whenever possible to ensure you are looking at the most up-to-date information.*

## What is an "open casebook", and how does it relate to copyright?

Open casebooks are legal casebooks which are available online and have open copyright licenses which permit anyone to use, share, and (usually) adapt the casebook at no cost. Compared to traditional legal casebooks, open casebooks can offer benefits of increased affordability, accessibility, and customizability. They are a specific type of OER (open educational resource). 

## What are the different kinds of open copyright licenses? 

### Creative Commons Licenses

The most common type of open copyright licenses are Creative Commons licenses. These licenses are globally used and recognized, fairly straightforward to use and understand, and offer six different license choices to suit different creator's wishes. All Creative Commons licenses permit free sharing of licensed materials, as long as attribution is given to the original creator. However, the six different Creative Commons licenses are more or less permissive when it comes to adaptation, sharing adapted materials, and commercial vs non-commercial uses. 

For example, this casebook's content (including this FAQ page!) is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license [(CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Under this license, anyone can share the contents of the casebook in any format, as well as adapt the material by changing, editing, or building on the casebook content. This license also carries three conditions: casebook material must be appropriately credited wherever it is shared, it cannot be used for commercial purposes, and any adapted versions of casebook content must be shared under the same Creative Commons license as the original (i.e. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). 

To learn more about the Creative Commons licenses, you can visit the following resources: 
* Creative Commons webpage "[About CC Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/)"
* TMU's *Open Textbook Authoring Guide*, "[About Creative Commons Licenses](https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/authorsguide/chapter/creative-commons-licenses/)"

### Other Open Licenses

There are alternative open licenses to Creative Commons, such as the GNU General Public License, Copyleft licenses, and the Ontario Commons Licenses. To learn more about alternative licenses, you can visit the following resources:
* BCCampus's *Faculty OER Toolkit*, "[11 Creative Commons Alternatives](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/facultyoertoolkit/chapter/creative-commons-alternatives/)"
* ECampus Ontario, "[Licensing](https://www.ecampusontario.ca/licensing/)"

## What is the copyright status of Canadian court decisions and legislation?

### Federal Cases and Legislation

All decisions of federal courts and tribunals, as well as all federal legislation, fall under the *Reproduction of Federal Law Order*, SI/97-5, which states that:

> Anyone may, without charge or request for permission, reproduce enactments and consolidations of enactments of the Government of Canada, and decisions and reasons for decisions of federally-constituted courts and administrative tribunals, provided due diligence is exercised in ensuring the accuracy of the materials reproduced and the reproduction is not represented as an official version.

This means that the text of federal cases and legislation can be used freely, provided you exercise due dilligence in ensuring the text is reproduced accurately and you don't present the reproduction as an official version. 

However, as [per the Supreme Court website](https://scc-csc.ca/terms-avis/notice-enonce-eng.aspx#cr-da), the *Reproduction of Federal Law Order* **does not apply to any editorial enhancements** that court reporters or legal databases add to cases. These enhancements could include headnotes, case summaries, works cited, and even paragraph numbers. Such enhancements may have their own terms of use or license which restricts how they can be copied or re-used. 

For example, the website for the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada, which hosts the Federal Court Reports, has [the following terms](https://www.fja-cmf.gc.ca/notices-avis/index-eng.html#copyright_permission_reproduce) which govern reproduction of their materials: 

> Information on this site has been posted with the intent that it be readily available for personal and public non-commercial use and may be reproduced, in part or in whole and by any means, without charge or further permission from the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada. We ask only that:
* Users exercise due diligence in ensuring the accuracy of the materials reproduced;
* The Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada be identified as the source department; and,
* The reproduction is not represented as an official version of the materials reproduced, nor as having been made, in affiliation with or with the endorsement of the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada.

### Provincial Cases and Legislation

Provincial cases and legislation do not fall under any single law which determines their copyright status. Instead, every province has different terms under which their cases and legislation can and cannot be used. 

For example, the Nova Scotia Legislature website (which hosts copies of all provincial legislation), states that:

> Users of this site may download, display, print, and reproduce material on this site for non-commercial use only. Any publication for commercial purposes or financial gain must receive the approval of the Speaker or, in the case of the statutes, the Chief Legislative Counsel. 

Similarly, the Nova Scotia Courts website (which hosts copies of all provincial court decisions), states that: 

> Copyright does not apply to publicly released court decisions, the Civil Procedure Rules and related court forms, Practice Memorandums, and  other public documents [...] The decisions and reasons for decision of the Nova Scotia Courts may be reproduced in whole or in part without further permission from the Courts.

> Further than court decisions, content on this website may be reproduced for non-commercial purposes, subject to the following requirements:
* Due diligence is exercised to ensure the accuracy and currency of the reproduced material; and 
* The Courts of Nova Scotia website ([WWW.COURTS.NS.CA](https://courts.ns.ca/)) is identified as the source.

For certain provinces, like [Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/copyright-information-c-queens-printer-ontario#section-1) and [BC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/copyright), copyright for legislation is held by the Queen's Printer of that province. In any case, the best way to determine copyright status for provincial cases and legislation is to look at the official provincial government websites which host cases and/or legislation and find their copyright/license policies. Links to these policies can often be found at the bottom of the website, and are usually indicated by words like "Disclaimer", "Terms of Use," "Copyright," or "Privacy Statement".

### Public Domain

Both federal and provincial government publications [fall under Crown Copyright](https://copyright.ubc.ca/public-domain/#Public_Domain_in_Canada). Under Crown Copyright, published works remain under copyright "for the remainder of the calendar year of the first publication of the work and for a period of fifty years following the end of that calendar year" (*[Copyright Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-3.html#docCont)*, R.S. 1985, c. C-42, s 12). If a Canadian court decision is in the public domain, it can be used freely, even without attribution. 

## So, how do I know if I can I use a Canadian court decision or piece of legislation in my open casebook? 

**If material is not in the public domain, always check the terms and conditions/copyright of the site or database you are retrieving the material from.**
 
See the previous question for instructions on how to find the terms and conditions/copyright information for materials hosted on governmental websites - but generally, the same instructions apply for private legal repositories as well: links to copyright policies can often be found at the bottom of the website, and are usually indicated by words like "Disclaimer", "Terms of Use," "Copyright," or "Privacy Statement". 

See below for more specific information on common Canadian legal databases. 

### CanLII

CanLII's [terms of use](https://www.canlii.org/en/info/terms.html) permit copying and using legislation and cases hosted on their site at no cost, *including editorial enhancements*, as long as:
* CanLII is identified as the source of the document
* No other terms and conditions apply to the material (for example, a government claiming additional copyright on legislation)

Note that these terms of use do not apply to books, journals, and other works in the "Commentary" section--different terms apply to these works. See https://www.canlii.org/en/info/terms.html for more information and the full terms of use. 

### Westlaw Canada and Lexis Quicklaw

Both Westlaw Canada and Lexis Quicklaw are paid, subscription databases and have terms of use which prohibit republishing their materials on another online platform like an open casebook. 

For more information, see:
* [Westlaw](https://store.thomsonreuters.ca/content/dam/ewp-m/documents/canada-store/en/pdf/other/westlaw-next-canada-licence-agreement.pdf): Canada License Agreement for WestlawNext Canad
* [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.ca/en-ca/terms/online-products.page): Terms & Conditions - Canada 

## What about cases and legislation from other countries?

 * [This document](https://www.barcouncilethics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Copyright-Status-of-Court-Judgments-1.pdf) outlines some information about the copyright status of court judgements in England. 
 * The *[Copyright Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00180)* contains information about Crown Copyright in Australia (sections 176-182) which applies to Australian court decisions and legislation. 
 * For all countries, be sure to check the relevant laws governing copyright in government materials, including when that material enteres the public domain.

## What about privacy expectations of parties involved in court cases?

The Canadian Judicial Council’s “[Model Policy for Access to Court Records in Canada](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/news\_pub\_techissues\_AccessPolicy\_2005_en.pdf)” recommends that when court judgements are posted on the internet, “it is a good practice to prevent indexing and cache storage from web robots or ‘spiders.’” This prevents judgements from being unintentionally found through web searches and being connected to parties involved. A [recent PIPEDA report](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2015/pipeda-2015-002/) (#2015-002) noted that the CJC’s “recommendation regarding indexing is followed by most courts and administrative tribunals in Canada, as well as CanLII and SOQUIJ." The same report found that a website that republished Canadian court and tribunal decisions, and allowed the personal information contained within those decisions to be indexed on the web, contravened PIPEDA (the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act*). 

While [PIPEDA only applies ](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/)to “private-sector organizations across Canada that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a commercial activity,” it’s still a good idea to ensure that the text of any cases you include in your online casebook are not indexed through Google and other web search softwares. This can be done by [adding a robots.txt file](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) to your website’s HTML. If you’re publishing a casebook on a specific platform, see if the platform has any tools or policies on web indexing.

## Can I use third-party material in my open casebook?

It depends. 

### Is the material in the public domain?

If the material is in the public domain, it has no copyright restrictions and you use it freely (even without attribution). However, just because material is available online **does not mean** it is in the public domain. The University of British Columbia has a detailed [guide](https://copyright.ubc.ca/public-domain/) available online which can help you determine whether or not materials are in the public domain. 

### Is the material openly licensed?

If the resource is openly licensed, through Creative Commons or a similar license, and your use of the material complies with the terms of the license, you can re-use the material. Again, though, just because material is freely accessible online **does not mean** it is openly licensed. The material's license should be clear and obvious. If not, don't use the material (or contact the creator to ask about license and copyright). 

Below is a list of tips for how to tell if material is openly licensed, excerpted from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s [Open Textbook Toolkit](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)): 

* Look for copyright information (who owns it) and licensing information (what are the conditions of use laid by the owner or copyright holder).
* If the copyright and licensing information isn’t immediately apparent on a website, click around and look at links such as “Terms and Conditions” and “Permissions”.
* If the copyright for is in the public domain, look for a clear marking of this.
* Be careful when using images found online. A photograph of a centuries old painting that you think is in the public domain may be copyrighted and released with a strict license (“All Rights Reserved”). 
* If you can’t find a copyright statement or copyright license, seek permission. If you don’t receive permission, don’t use it.
* Even if a website is labelled as “open”, unless the material is clearly marked with an open copyright license or uses a public domain tool, seek permission. If you don’t receive permission, don’t use it.
* Don’t use a resource for which one-time permission has been granted by the creator. (Creative Commons licenses permit unlimited usage). Instead, if you find material that you want to use but hasn’t been released with an open copyright license, try contacting the author or creator and ask if he/she will consider doing so.

You might want to consider using the following resources for finding openly licensed content: 

* The University of Toronto's [Open Textbook Toolkit](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) lists several resources to help find Creative Commons material. 
* Smartcopying Australia also offers a [guide](https://smartcopying.edu.au/creative-commons-information-pack-for-teachers-and-students/) for finding general Creative Commons material using Google and YouTube. 

### Do I have permission from the copyright holder to use the material? 

If material is not openly licensed nor in the public domain, you can try to obtain permission from the copyright holder to use their materials. However, as the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s [Open Textbook Toolkit](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) makes clear, "[s]imply asking for permission isn’t enough in this case; it is important to be clear to the copyright owner that the material will be released under an open license." The [Toolkit](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) also offers more instructions and a sample permissions request that you may find useful.

## How can I use a journal article in my open casebook?

### Look for instructions on how to submit a re-use request.

Start by looking for a page on the journal website with instructions about copyright and re-use inquiries (often found under pages called "Permissions", "Terms and Conditions", "Copyright Policy", etc.). These pages will usually contain specific instructions about copyright, publication licenses, and/or how to request permission for re-use. For example, the [Canadian Bar Review](https://cbr.cba.org/index.php/cbr/about/submissions#privacyStatement) requires a written request to the journal and the author, while the [University of Toronto Law Journal ](https://utpjournals.press/journals/utlj/permissions)has a specific form to fill out to request permission to reprint their materials. 

### Check Copyright Clearance Center's Website

Some publishers, such as the [University of Chicago Law Review](https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/contact), funnel copyright clearance requests through the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC). Often this will be indicated on the journal's website, but you can always search the title of the journal or publisher on their [Marketplace site](https://marketplace.copyright.com/) to see if you can request permissions through CCC. Note, though, that CCC's form may not necessarily fit a permissions request for an open casebook, in which case you may have to contact the journal directly. 

### See if the journal and journal article are published under an open license. 

Some journal articles are published under open licenses, such as Creative Commons licenses. This means sharing and/or adapting these articles in your casebook *could be* permitted without needing to ask for permission. For example, the [Dalhousie Law Journal](https://digitalcommons.schulichlaw.dal.ca/dlj/policies.html#copyright) states that their articles are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US), which allows free re-use and re-mixing of materials (with credit). Similarly, the [Supreme Court Law Review](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/journals/52/) archives hosted on CanLII are under a [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license, which permits free sharing of materials for non-commercial purposes (with credit), but does not permit publication of derivative works.

### If all else fails, contact the journal directly. 

If a journal does not provide any specific information about how their articles can be used, or specific instructions for how to ask for permission to re-use information, contacting the journal directly is usually best practice. The University of Toronto's Open Textbook Toolkit's [sample template](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) for requesting permission from a rights holder to use a copyrighted work may be helpful. 

## How do I properly attribute copyrighted materials in my open casebook?

### Creative Commons licensed materials

When attributing Creative Commons licensed materials, there are four elements you should be sure to include:
* Title
* Creator - including a link to the creator's profile
* Source - including a link to the original source
* License - including a link to the license deed

For example, the above four elements are adapted from [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)' "[How to give attribution](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/attribution/)" webpage, licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 

It's also important to include any additional conditions or warranties attached to the license of the original material, if applicable. 

For more information on attributing Creative Commons licensed material, the Creative Commons wiki has a [helpful page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution) with more information on best practices for attribution. 

### Non-openly licensed materials

The [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s [Open Textbook Toolkit](https://openetext.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/copyright/) (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) offers the following example of attribution for a copyrighted item you've received permission to use: 

> The photo _Cats cuddling in a basket_ is © 2017 John Smith. All rights reserved, used with permission.

## What about the "fair dealing exception"?

Section 29 of the *Copyright Act*, RSC 1985, c C-42, sets out the fair dealing exception to copyright. Under this exception, 

> Fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, parody or satire does not infringe copyright.

The law surrounding what makes dealings "fair" is complicated. Your university may have a specific resource on fair dealing at your university - for example, Dalhousie University's [Fair Dealing Guidelines](https://libraries.dal.ca/services/copyright-office/guidelines/fair-dealing-guidelines.html). The following resources may also be helpful for understanding what is and isn't fair dealing: 

* For a general overview of fair dealing, the Canadian Association of Research Libraries has a short course called [Copyright Open Educational Resource for University Instructors and Staff](https://www.carl-abrc.ca/influencing-policy/copyright/opencopyrightcourse/). Module 5 covers User Rights, including the fair dealing exception. 

* For a more in-depth look at fair dealing, the University of Alberta Libraries has a series of instructional modules called [Opening Up Copyright](https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/copyright/, ), including the module [Section 29: Fair Dealing.](https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/copyright/modules/section-29-fair-dealing/)
