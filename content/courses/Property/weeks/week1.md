For first-year law students, property law can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, sometimes disorienting. Property spans multiple legal traditions and offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of apparent contradictions. 

The are many possible ways to teach and learn about property, to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will take a critical historical approach that may look different from your other first-year courses. More specifically, we will use the following question about law, history and political economy to thread the material together:

> *How have legal rules about property produced Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and who benefits from the result?* 

In other words, we will take a social concept—*the market*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that concept over time in the Canadian context.

That Canada has a certain kind of market economy, along with that economy's particular distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of choices that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state. By taking a critical look at those choices and what constrains them, we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions and their potential for change. 

These are big ideas and I will have much more to say about this overarching frame in a few weeks. For now, simply be aware that such a frame exists and that we will return to it as a touchstone again and again throughout the course. 

## Course Syllabuses

Before you start to read the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the [Course Syllabus](../../admin/syllabus) and reviewing the [Course Schedule](../../admin/schedule).
