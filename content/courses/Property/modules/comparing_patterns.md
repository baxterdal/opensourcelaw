title: 'Argument Pairs: Comparing Patterns'
short: Comparing Patterns
---


Last week, we discussed the concept of "argument pairs" as one of the basic structures of common law arguments and started to identify some of those pairs in *Harrison v Carswell*. This week, we will take the same approach to reading *Moore v Regents of the University of California*--a case were we see an even larger number of these argument pairs at work.

As with *Harrison*, I have provided you with a colour-coded version of the judgements in *Moore* so that you can more easily identify linked argument pairs and jump between them as you read the majority and dissenting decisions in relationship to one another. Once you have a grasp of the facts and the substance of the arguments being made by Justices Panelli and Mosk, ask yourself: which patterns of argumentation have you seen before? Can you link any patterns of argument between *Harrison* and *Moore*?
