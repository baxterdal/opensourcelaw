title: 'Property Law: Making the Market'
short: Market

Throughout the course, we will study several controversies, concepts and legal doctrines that normally make up the field of property law in most Canadian law schools. As in your other courses, you will gain a solid understanding of legal rules "on the books" that address a range of issues (local, national and global) and you will see how those rules have changed and been adapted over time. But in this course we will also address legal rules with a specific goal in mind--one that goes beyond a basic proficiency in the common law or legislation. Our goal is to understand and develop a thoughtful answer to the following question:

*How have legal rules about property constructed Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and who benefits from the result?*

In other words, we will take a social institution—the *market economy*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that institution over time in the Canadian context.[^purdy] A "liberal" market economy is one based on certain political values like privacy and individual freedom--we will have much more to say about this concept and its relationship to property law in later classes.

The idea that Canada has one kind of market economy with its specific distribution of benefits and burdens is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of *choices* that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state.[^stein2012] By taking a critical look at those choices we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions, as well as their potential for change.

Too often, we take legal rules that structure the market for granted and accept that the resulting benefits and burdens are the natural consequences of market competition. Legal rules are viewed primarily as interventions by government in free exchanges between individuals, with the goal of mitigating the market's adverse or unequal effects. But this perspective overlooks the whole infrastructure of legal rules in property, contract and other areas that make such exchanges possible in the first place.

We can start to address this oversight--and thereby engage the question of how property rules underpin Canada's market economy--by focusing on three key assumptions about law and economic markets that we often make in debates and discussions about social and economic policy. After you review these three assumptions, the exercise that follows asks you to identify them in a real-world example.

### Three assumptions about law and the market economy

***Natural***: free market exchange is a natural condition of human societies, while regulation by government through law is an unnatural or artificial constraint. This assumption is based on a taken-for-granted separation of the market from the legal system, where the former is independent of and prior to the latter. The analogy here is to something like a natural watercourse that might be artificially unnaturally dammed or diverted by human engineering or other interventions. 

***Neutral***: while there are winners and losers from market exchange, this distribution of benefits and burdens is simply the natural consequence of market competition. This vision of neutrality conceals the reality that expressing legal rules involves the exercise of judgement, discretion and power, and that such decisions inevitably privilege certain interests and values over others. 

***Necessary***: when market exchange and competition are seen as both natural and neutral, it follows that the economy's current form is necessary, i.e. inevitable. But, as we will see throughout the course, the legal history of property is full of contingencies and real choices that were not at all inevitable--meaning that difference choices,  and therefore different distributions of benefits and burdens, were equally possible.
