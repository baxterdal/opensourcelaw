Throughout the course, we will study several controversies, concepts and legal doctrines that conventionally make up the field of property law in Canadian law schools. As in your other courses, you will gain a solid understanding of the "law of the books" addressing a range of issues (local, national and global) and you will see how that law has changed and been adapted over time. But we will do all of this with a more specific goal in mind than becoming proficient in property law. By the end of this course, we want to gain a critical understanding of the following question:

*How have legal rules about property created Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and **who benefits** from the result?*

In other words, we will take a social concept—the *market*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that concept over time in the Canadian context.

That Canada has a certain kind of market economy, along with that economy's particular distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined (Desautels-Stein 2012, 391). Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of *choices* that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state. By taking a critical look at those choices and what constrains them, we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions along with their potential for change.

Too often, however, we take the legal rules that structure the market for granted and accept that the resulting benefits and burdens are the natural consequences of market competition. From that perspective, law has a role to play but it is one restricted to interventions, by the state, in free exchange between individuals to mitigate its adverse or unequal effects. What this perspective misses is the whole infrastructure of legal rules that make such exchange possible in the first place.
