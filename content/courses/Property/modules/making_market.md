title: 'Property Law: Making the Market'

Throughout the course, we will study several controversies, concepts and legal doctrines that normally make up the field of property law in most Canadian law schools. As in your other courses, you will gain a solid understanding of legal rules "on the books" that address a range of issues (local, national and global) and you will see how those rules have changed and been adapted over time. But we will also address legal rules with a specific goal in mind--one that goes beyond a basic proficiency in the common law or legislation. Our goal is to understand and develop a thoughtful answer to the following question:

*How have legal rules about property created Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years, and who benefits from the result?*

In other words, we will take a social institution—the *market economy*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that institution over time in the Canadian context.[^purdy] A "liberal" market economy is one based on certain political values like privacy and individual freedom. We will have much more to say about this concept of a liberal market economy and its relationship to property law in later classes.

The idea that Canada has one kind of market economy, with its specific distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of societal *choices* that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state.[^stein2012] By taking a critical look at those choices we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions, as well as their potential for change.

The problem is that, too often, we take these legal rules that structure the market for granted, and we accept that the resulting benefits and burdens are the natural consequences of market competition. Legal rules are seen mainly as interventions by government in free exchanges between individuals, with the goal of mitigating the market's adverse or unequal effects. But this perspective overlooks the expansive infrastructure of legal rules in property and other areas that make such exchanges possible in the first place.

We can start to address this problem of perspective--and thereby engage the question of how property rules underpin Canada's liberal market economy--by focusing on three key assumptions about law and economic markets that we often make in debates and discussions about social and economic policy. After you review these three assumptions below, the exercise that follows asks you to identify them in a real-world example.

### Three assumptions about law and the economy

The three key assumptions sketched below are pervasive in court cases, in public policy forums, and in the media when people are debating and discussing the relationship between law and the economy. They run so deep that we often fail to notice them. The problem with these three assumptions--and a failure to treat them as such--is that they tend to view "law" and the "economy" as separate and distinct phenomena, instead of two aspects of social life that constitute one another. These assumptions draw our attention away from the central idea that economies and economic exchange cannot exist without some underlying legal rules or norms. What forms of economic exchange exist--and who benefits from those exchanges--are therefore determined in large part by those who shape the law and the choices they make. 

***Assumption #1: Free Markets are Natural*** -- we often take as given that "free" market exchange is a natural condition of human societies, while accepting that regulation by government through law is an unnatural or artificial constraint on economic activity. This assumption is based on a taken-for-granted separation of the market from the legal system, where the former is assumed to be independent of and prior to the latter. To understand this assumption, we can draw a useful analogy to a natural watercourse (we will return to vividly to this analogy in [Week 8](../week8)). Rivers and streams might be "artificially" damned or the water diverted by human engineering. But while the river in this analogy might have very well have preceded any human intervention and therefore be characterized as "natural", But are we right to describe a particular system of economic exchange in the same way?

***Assumption #2: The Consequences of Market Competition are Neutral*** -- if free market exchange is assumed to be a natural condition of human societies, it follows that the resulting distribution of benefits and burdens--of advantage and disadvantage--is itself a natural consequence of market competition. In other words, market outcomes are *neutral* to the extent that they remain free from "political" interference.  This assumption of neutrality conceals the reality that creating or modifying legal rules involves the exercise of judgement, discretion and power, and that such decisions inevitably privilege certain interests and values over others. 

***Assumption #3: Our Current System of Economic Exchange is Necessary*** -- of course, some form of economic exchange is necessary for human societies to function and flourish. But accepting this assertion is distinct from the idea that our actual, real-world economy in its *current form* is necessary, i.e. inevitable. As we will see throughout the course, the legal history of property is full of contingencies and real choices taken by real people--choices that were not at all inevitable. This means that difference choices, and therefore different distributions of benefits and burdens, were possible. Acknowledging this idea says nothing about whether the choices taken were right or wrong--only that they were in fact *choices* and not the predetermined result of a natural or neutral institution.
