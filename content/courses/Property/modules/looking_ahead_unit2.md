title: Looking Ahead to Unit 2
short: Looking Ahead

Having spent some time analyzing some patterns of common law argument in Unit 1, you might now be wondering how the argument pairs the we see recurring across cases can ever serve as the basis for actually *resolving* a legal problem. If these patterns of argument and counter-argument are reasonably predictable, can such a structure of reasoning ever provide us with the "correct" legal answer? 

This question will more or less occupy us for the remainder of our course this year, and I will try to convince you that we cannot hope to answer it until we have developed a deeper historical understanding of property law in Canada. Having looked at the basic structure of argument pairs as the pervasive "vocabulary" of common law reasoning, we turn in Unit 2 to the concept of legal "style" that often drives how this vocabulary is deployed to make one's case.
