Abandonment occurs when a piece of property is voluntarily given up by its owner. [^abandonment_cases] Crucially, abandonment requires the owner to *intend* to permanently abandon their property: they must have “the intention of terminating ownership, possession and control.” [^Manning]

For example, in the 2008 case *Manning v Algard*, the defendant Algard lost or misplaced a briefcase containing 17th century gold coins. Those coins were later sold to Manning in a garage sale. Since Algard had lost or misplaced his briefcase rather than intentionally left it behind, the court found he had not abandoned the coins and Algard’s estate still owned them.
