title: 'Land, Property and Colonialism in this Course'
short: Colonialism
---

Throughout this course we will examine several features of Canada's liberal market economy. One of those features is the country's economic foundations in the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples through the institution of property. But colonialism is not only a *feature* or characteristic of the Canadian economy (one that is structured by law)--it also an ongoing *reality* of how we learn about property, including the frameworks, theories and perspectives we use to make sense of legal rules and disputes. Colonialism shapes the interpretation and application of law, as well as the questions we tend to ask about those processes. 

Because colonialism pervades the study of law, an important component of our course this year is to develop some approaches to learning about property as part of an anti-colonial practice. As an initial step, we can take care in the way we think and speak about the two concepts at the heart of this course--land and property--and the relationship between them.

The most basic point is that "land" and "property" are not the same concepts, despite an everyday tendency to conflate them. From the common law's perspective, land is a "thing"--an object or resource--while property defines a set of legal relationships between people with respect to things ```[CITE, and add example]```. 

This way of speaking about land and property helps us to decipher many of the complex legal topics you will encounter in this course (such as the idea of legal possession, or the common law doctrine of estates in land). But it also serves to hide or obscure other types of relationships concerning land and territory in ways that perpetuate and reinforce settler colonial justifications for taking land away from Indigenous peoples. For example, Clifford Atleo and Jonathan Boron contrast the view of land as a "thing" with the understanding by many Indigenous peoples of "land as a relative...with agency and worthy of respect."[^atleo2022] From this perspective, the common law may distinguish between land and property on its own terms, but it also works to transform land *into* property and thereby sever fundamental relationships between land and Indigenous communities. 

An important consequence of the move from "land" to "property" is therefore to dissociate law and land relations from their particular *time* and *place*. [^liboiron2021] To the extent that a focus on the rules of common law property allow us to abstract away from conflicts grounded in actual places and historical events, the study of property law can too easily justify or cover over both past and contemporary injustices. One way to combat this impulse is to situate the study property as much as possible in the place where we are actually learning and teaching about it.

### Key Challenges 

- *Ahistoricism*: a lack of concern for the history of land as well as legal rules, principles and doctrines applied to land. The common law's tendency to transform "land" into "property" often has the direct effect of dissociating the land from its history and drawing attention away from historical claims and relationships [@marciamckenzieandevetuckPlaceResearchTheory, 64]. When we remove or ignore the history behind a legal concept like "possession" or "title", it is much easier to cast that concept as natural, neutral and legitimate.

- *Invisibility*: in apparent contradiction to the dynamic of ahistoricism, a second challenge is the temptation to think of colonization only as a historical event rather than a current reality [@tuck2014LandEducationIndigenous, 7]. This way of thinking attempts to make colonialism invisible and to render the obligations flowing from that same history as artifacts rather than living relationships. In a legal context, it often drives us to devise "alternative" explanations for legal doctrines that perpetuate rather than confront colonialism. 

- *Subsumation*: the move to subsume or submerge Indigenous legal systems and systems of knowledge--"entire worlds" [@liboiron2021pollution, 54]--within dominant systems of colonial law and thought is also pervasive in the colonial perspective. Sometimes, instead of making these worlds invisible, subsuming dynamics work to obscure deeper contradictions between principles or worldviews by giving them the gloss of commensurability [@mckay2010CanadianPassiveRevolution, 368-369].
