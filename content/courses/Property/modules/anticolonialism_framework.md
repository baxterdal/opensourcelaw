title: 'Land, Property and Colonialism in this Course'
short: Colonialism
---

One of the features of Canada's liberal market economy is its foundations in the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples through the transformation of *land* into *property* ```[CITE/EXPLAIN]```. But colonialism is not only a feature of our economy, structured by law. It is also an ongoing reality of how we learn about property law (and other aspects of law), including the frameworks we use to make sense of legal materials and the questions we ask about them.

The question for our class at this early stage is how to approach the study of property law as part of an anti-colonial practice. The answer to that question is not simple or easy to generalize, but a useful starting point is what ```[CITE]``` call an "ethic of incommensurability". Incommensurability means ... ```[EXPLAIN]```

The following are three key challenges that attention to this idea of incommensurability can help to address.

### Key Challenges 

- *Ahistoricism*: a lack of concern for the history of land as well as legal rules, principles and doctrines applied to land. The common law's tendency to transform "land" into "property" often has the direct effect of dissociating the land from its history and drawing attention away from historical claims and relationships [@marciamckenzieandevetuckPlaceResearchTheory, 64]. When we remove or ignore the history behind a legal concept like "possession" or "title", it is much easier to cast that concept as natural, neutral and legitimate.

- *Invisibility*: in apparent contradiction to the dynamic of ahistoricism, a second challenge is the temptation to think of colonization only as a historical event rather than a current reality [@tuck2014LandEducationIndigenous, 7]. This way of thinking attempts to make colonialism invisible and to render the obligations flowing from that same history as artifacts rather than living relationships. In a legal context, it often drives us to devise "alternative" explanations for legal doctrines that perpetuate rather than confront colonialism. 

- *Subsumation*: the move to subsume or submerge Indigenous legal systems and systems of knowledge--"entire worlds" [@liboiron2021pollution, 54]--within dominant systems of colonial law and thought is also pervasive in the colonial perspective. Sometimes, instead of making these worlds invisible, subsuming dynamics work to obscure deeper contradictions between principles or worldviews by giving them the gloss of commensurability [@mckay2010CanadianPassiveRevolution, 368-369].
