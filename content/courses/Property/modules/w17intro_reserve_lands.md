This week, we return to the context of Indigenous land rights and governance. In [Week 6](../week6/) we studied the common law origins of the doctrine of Aboriginal title, and in [Week 7](../week7/) we examined treaty interpretation in Mi'kma'ki and its relationship to Mi'kmaw land tenure. For Week 17, we take as our focus property rights and title in reserve lands governed under the federal *Indian Act* and recent initiatives by some Indigenous communities to address longstanding barriers posed by that regime. 

Building on our discussions about housing issues throughout Unit 3, our case study this week addresses the context of housing and business development on reserve lands. This case study offers the chance to gain a better understanding of the comparative—and often complex—set of options available to Indigenous communities to govern their reserve lands in a multi-juridical context.
