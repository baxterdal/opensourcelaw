When we studied cases of remedy in nuisance (as a question of property owners' rights to exclude) in Week 8, we noted that the land-use disputes in these cases were archetypes of the basic dilemma at the heart of legal liberalism: neighbouring landowners each want to be free to use their land in their own way and toward their own ends—but such unrestricted freedom is impossible for one without putting constraints on the other. 

Conventionally, civil claims in nuisance—along with restrictive covenants (which we will study later this term—were the common law's primary means of addressing such land use conflicts. But by the mid-20th century, these conflicts were increasingly subject to local legislative regimes, foremost among them municipal land use plans and the zoning by-laws used to implement those plans. Land use controls of this nature were designed to be forward-looking and comprehensive within a locality. They operated primarily by dividing the land into "zones" defined by permitted or prohibited uses (e.g. residential uses, commercial uses, industrial uses, etc). By enforcing a certain physical separation between what were seen as conflicting uses of land, planning and zoning instruments meant to prevent such conflicts from occurring in the first place. These tools became ever-more important as urban centres continued to grow in size and density.

As we saw last week, these increasingly stringent and sophisticated land use controls have been claimed, in some instances, to amount to a *de facto* expropriation of landowners' property. We also saw that the chances of successfully making out such a claim have historically been limited in Canadian law. Instead, as Justice Binnie notes at paragraph 12 in the *Saint-Romuald (City) v Olivier*, below, a sort of compromise position was struck by the courts: "[t]o counter the concern about confiscation without compensation, lawful existing uses came to be protected under the concept of *acquired rights*.

### What are Acquired Rights?

Acquired rights (or "non-conforming uses" in common law jurisdictions, or more colloquially, "grandfathered uses") are vested property rights that have been acquired by landowners through actual use of their land under a given regulatory regime. Once these rights are vested, future changes to the regulatory regime prohibiting the original use leave the landowner's acquired rights unaffected. 

Acquired rights were initially an invention of the courts, though today they are often enshrined in local legislation. The basic function of acquired rights is to shield landowners, to a degree, from the uncertainties associated with evolving land use controls in accordance with processes of public planning.
