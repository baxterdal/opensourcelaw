This week we cover two topics that link back issues of exclusion we've studied throughout the course. The first topic provides a contemporary perspective on the question of *de facto* expropriation, which we first addressed in [Week 9](../week9/) and then revisited in [Week 11](../week11/). The second topic concerns the right to exclude in the context of intellectual propertyâ€”namely patent rights acquired by inventors and used to exclude others from making or using that invention for some period of time. 

Through both of these topics, we continue to see the courts' turn toward a contemporary style of common law reasoning that rests on a pragmatic combination of elements from both the classical and modern perspectives. As you work through the materials this week, aim to identify where these elements of earlier styles appear and ask yourself whether their combination results in a coherent framework for legal reasoning.
