In the quarter century after he wrote *The Path of Law*, Holmes became a leading member of the United States Supreme Court and in 1922 he penned the majority decision in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*. *Mahon* became a foundational case in American law on the issue of *de facto* expropriation ("constructive takings" in American legal parlance)—one that affirmed landowners' rights to compensation for such expropriations as protected under the United States Constitution. 

*Mahon* is a useful case for us because it is an early example in which both judges—Holmes for the majority, and Brandeis in dissent—demonstrate a willingness to embrace the modern style, despite the fact that they disagree on the outcome of the case. At the same time, we still see vestiges of the classical approach. As you read the two decisions in *Mahon*, try to identify the work being done by Holmes' functionalist method from *The Path of Law*, along with that being done by the other important features of the modern style described above. On what grounds do the judges in the case disagree about whether or not there has been a *de facto* expropriation of the coal company's property?
