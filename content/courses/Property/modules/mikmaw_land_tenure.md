If effective recognition for and implementation of the Peace and Friendship Treaties was set on poor footing in the *Syliboy* decision, how might we understand the possibilities for an alternative path forward for Indigenous-Crown relationships? Any answer to that question must start with engaging Indigenous legal orders as diverse systems of law forming part of Canada's multi-juridical landscape. Building an authentic, comparative understanding across legal systems is clearly a big undertaking (consider how much effort and energy you are currently expending to learn just the basics of the Anglo-Canadian common law). But it is just as clearly an achievable goal—and one that is increasingly within reach, led by a growing body of Indigenous legal scholarship, research and teaching. 

James (Sa’ke’j) Youngblood Henderson explains Mi'kmaw law in the context of treaty in the following way:[^henderson1995]

> The prerogative Treaties enabled the two worldviews and different societies to make a new normative world using the irony of jurisdictions, obligations and rights. To live in the new legal world required each culture to know not only the meaning of the alliance and its terms, but also the connections or transformations that resulted when one normative system passed through another. The prerogative Treaties constructed, through mutual consent, a new normative system out of the various constructions of reality and visions of what the world might be.

> For example, the Wabanaki and Mikmaq applied the customary concept of harmony and forgiveness to the English. Specifically, article 2 of the *Mikmaw Compact*, 1752, stated that "all Transactions during the Late War on both sides be buried in Oblivion with the Hatchet." This fragile quest for an explicit order between the diverse federations through consensual Treaties provided the foundation upon which developed the first British Empire and their colonies, and eventually the United Kingdom.

As you do so, can you identify differences and similarities between the structure of Mi'kmaw legal thought and the structure of common law thought studied so far in this course? How might the Peace and Friendship treaties above be interpreted from the perspective of Mi'kmaw land tenure described in the article?
