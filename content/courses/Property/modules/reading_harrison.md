title: Reading Harrison v Carswell
short: Reading
---

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is compelling because the issues and arguments seem to transcend those facts, speaking to much bigger questions about law and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 

Next week, when we return to *Harrison v Carswell* for a second reading of the case, I will try to convince you that this question of who has the better or more persuasive arguments is not really an important question — or at least, it is not the *most* important question about *Harrison* — at this stage of your legal education. Rather than focusing on whether one or the other set of reasons are good or bad from a legal (or any other) standpoint, I will ask you to focus on the question of *how* the legal reasoning in *Harrison* actually works in practice. 

Here is another way of posing this challenge for you to think about before Week 2. In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.
