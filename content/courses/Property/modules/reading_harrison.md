title: Reading Harrison v Carswell
short: Reading

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is compelling because the issues and arguments seem to transcend those facts, speaking to much bigger questions about law and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are objectively *better* or more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 




In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.
