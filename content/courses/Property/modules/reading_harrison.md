The first case we’ll read in this course--the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in *Harrison v Carswell*--is about a labour dispute at the Polo Park shopping mall in Winnipeg in the mid-1970s. That setting may not strike you as obviously important or exciting, but *Harrison* is arguably one of the Supreme Court's most important decisions for what it reveals about the central problems and debates in property law, and--more important still--for what it shows us about *how* judges and lawyers engage in those debates using the patterns and practices of common law legal argument.

This week, I am only asking you to read a single case, and a reasonably short one at that. But I am asking you to read that case twice, with two different sets of questions in mind. These two sets of questions correspond to the two versions of *Harrison v Carswell* below. 

To begin, read the first version of *Harrison* with the following questions in mind:

- What are the basic facts of the case? Do the two different judges in the case (Justices Dickson and Laskin) emphasize or describe different facts? 

- What is the central issue in the case? Can you describe that issue both in formal legal jargon and in everyday terms?

- What is the procedural history of the case (i.e. the outcomes for the parties in the courts below)?

- What is the final result in the case? Who wins and who loses? Which judge sides with which party? 

- What do the judges mean by "trespass"? What do they mean by "possession"? How are these two concepts related?

Note that, at this point, I am specifically *not* asking you to focus on the reasoning behind the two judges decisions, or about which set of reasons you agree or disagree with. We will address those important questions later. 

<!--

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is a compelling case because the issues and arguments seem so clearly to transcend those facts. The judges engage big questions about law, legal reasoning and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are objectively *better* or more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 



In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.
