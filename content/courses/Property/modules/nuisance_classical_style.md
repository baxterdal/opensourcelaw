The English Court of Appeal's judgement in *Shelfer* left subsequent judicial decisions open to considerable uncertainty as to how to apply Lord Justice Smith's test and therefore the circumstances under which a landowner's right to exclude in nuisance would be strictly enforced or not.

The Canadian common law on remedy in nuisance in the early twentieth century thus offers a useful case study in how judges relied on the fundamental premises of the classical legal style to "resolve" what was in effect a highly indeterminate doctrine. In the two cases below — *Black v Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canada Paper Co. v Brown* — the judges are confronted with what looks like very similar facts: large-scale industrial pollution causing damage to close-by private landowners. And yet, the judges reach quite different conclusions on the question of remedy (although the parties in fact agree on the remedy in *Black v Canadian Copper Co.*, Justice Middleton nevertheless devotes substantial discussion to the issue). 

How do the judges in these two cases draw on the style of classical common law reasoning to reach their decisions? In what ways do the judges interpret some land uses as "natural" and other "unnatural" and what role does this framing play in the decisions? 

Are you persuaded that one case is correctly and the other wrongly decided? Are the decisions necessarily irreconcilable?
