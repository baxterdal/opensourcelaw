The early eighteenth-century in what is today Eastern Canada was characterized by political and military struggles and alliances between three powers in the region: the Wabanaki (a political alliance of Mi'kmaw, Wolastoqiyik, and Passamaquoddy peoples, and a separate alliance of communities known as the Abenaki), the British, and the French. 1726 saw the end of a three-year war between New England and the Wabanaki, which had been grounded in concerns about colonial expansion northward (including incursions on Indigenous fishing territories and colonial land settlement). In turn, the British were becoming increasingly motivated to forge friendly relationships with the Wabanaki as counter-weight to French power. This period culminated in the signing of the Treaty of 1725 by various parties between that year and 1726.

It is important to distinguish the 1725 treaty from what are sometimes called the "numbered treaties"â€”one of which was in issue in *St. Catherine's Milling*. While the latter treaties have been interpreted by common law courts as "land cession" treaties in which First Nations ceded their land rights to the Crown, the 1725 treaty and subsequent treaties in Atlantic Canada are understood as treaties in which the Indigenous signatories did not cede any of their land rights or their authority to govern their lands.

A general word of caution when reading these treaty documents: the interpretation of historical treaties is a complex exercise. There can be several reasons for this, as described below.[^wicken2002]

### Treaty Interpretation

Consider the following challenges related to the interpretation of historical treaties:

- a given treaty may be comprised of multiple documents spanning several years, across changing contexts, and involving different signatories;

- a lack of historical documentation, such as contemporaneous minutes of the treaty signing;

- the possibility (in some cases, the likelihood) that parties to the treaty came with and developed differing understandings of their relationships and obligations to one another;

- the bias against oral traditions inherent in written treaty texts;

- the diversity of interests, perspectives and alliances among Indigenous communities.

Keep these points in mind as you read the treaty texts below, as well as the decision in *R v Syliboy*.
