title: Scope of Acquired Rights

The Privy Council's rejection of what the Supreme Court in *Saint-Romuald (City)v Olivier*, below, calls the "categorical approach" means that acquired rights are defined not according to formal categories in a land-use bylaw but based the actual use of land in practice. But this raises a central challenge: how should the scope of such rights be defined? Too narrow an interpretation would render the acquired rights ineffective, while too broad and interpretation would run the equal risk of nullifying the city's planning powers. 

This is the central question taken up in *Saint-Romuald*. While Justices Binnie and Gonthier agree on a rejection of the "categorical approach", they disagree on how the scope of the respondent's acquired rights should be defined in this case. 

What, then, is the legal test for defining the limits of acquired rights? How does the disagreement between the judges about the legal relevance of "personal value judgments" or the "values of the society" help us to situate the case in relationship to the modern common law style? 

After reading *Saint-Romuald* in light of these questions, return to consider the [problem on short-term rentals in HRM](#problem-short-term-rentals-in-hrm), above.
