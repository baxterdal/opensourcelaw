title: '*De Facto* Expropriation in Canadian Law'

*The Path of Law* and *Mahon* are both American sources but they—like others we have seen in the course—exerted a significant influence over the thinking of Canadian jurists during the twentieth century. The American law loomed large in this area because of its especially strong protections for private property against uncompensated takings. Nevertheless, other than a small handful of cases prior to the 1990s, a specifically Canadian jurisprudence around *de facto* expropriation remained all but ignored by Canadian judges. It was not until the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal's decision in *Mariner Real Estate Ltd.* that anything like a recognizable legal test for *de facto* expropriation began to emerge.

As you read *Mariner*, below, focus on two important aspects of the case:

1. The degree to which Justice Cromwell's decision is structured by features of the modern style we have identified so far—in what ways does the decision conform or not to the modern style?

2. The specific legal test for *de facto* expropriation that emerges from the case—how would you articulate the elements of this test?

Once you have grappled with these questions, return to the [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove problem](#problem-blue-mountain-birch-cove-lakes) and consider how the issue in that case might be resolved, based on the law you've learned so far this week. We will take this up together in our online meeting.
