*The Path of Law* and *Mahon* are both American sources but they—like others we have seen in the course—exerted a significant influence over the thinking of Canadian jurists during the twentieth century. The American law loomed large in this area because of its especially strong protections for private property against uncompensated takings. 

Nevertheless, other than a small handful of cases prior to the 1990s, the domestic jurisprudence around *de facto* expropriation remained all but ignored by Canadian judges. It was not until the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal's decision in *Mariner Real Estate Ltd.* that anything like a recognizable legal test for *de facto* expropriation began to emerge.

**What to look for:** As you read *Mariner*, below, think about two important aspects.

- In what ways does Justice Crownwell's decision conform or not to the modern style?

- What elements of a legal test for *de facto* expropriation emerge from the case?

Once you have read *Mariner*, return to the [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove problem](#problem-blue-mountain-birch-cove-lakes) and consider how this problem might be resolved based on the law you've learned this week. We will take this up together in our class meeting.
