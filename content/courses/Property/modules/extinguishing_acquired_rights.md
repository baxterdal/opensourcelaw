Different provinces have different legislation in place governing how acquired rights or "legal non-conforming uses" can be extinguished. For example, in *Saint-Romuald*, the court notes that under Quebec legislation, "municipality may not...order the cessation of [legal non-conforming uses] unless they have been abandoned or interrupted for 'a reasonable period' no shorter than six months." 

In Nova Scotia, the *Municipal Government Act*, SNS 1998, c 18, s 240 (excerpted below) governs the extinguishment of acquired rights for all land outside the HRM. A nearly-identical provision can also be found in section 255 of the *Halifax Regional Municipality Charter*, SNS 2008, c 39.

> (c) recommenced, if discontinued for a continuous period of six months.[^municipal_government]
