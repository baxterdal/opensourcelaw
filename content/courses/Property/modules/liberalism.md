In our last unit, we looked at the "vocabulary" of common law legal arguments—the lexicon of typical, patterned argument types used by judges and lawyers to debate and reason through the merits of a case. At the end of Week 3, our discussion of this common law vocabulary left us with a nagging question: *how can arguments with this structure ever help us to resolve a case, to decide which judgement is more convincing or persuasive?* If every argument bite has one or more predictable counter-argument bites, how does one side ever "win out" over the other?

From a historical perspective, the answer to this question depends on *when* we are asking it. For the remainder of this course, we will look at three contrasting periods of legal thought: the *classical* period, the *modern* period and the *contemporary* period. While legal arguments in each of these periods share a basic structure or "grammar", they differ dramatically in terms of "style"—that is, how this basic grammar is employed and presented to persuade its audience.[^stein2018]

For our purposes, we'll simply call this basic grammar of the common law "liberalism". Liberalism is a schematic for legal and political thought that rests on a basic dilemma: humans should be free to compete with one another, but the benefits of this free competition for society require limitations on individual freedom. Individual freedom for any person—as measured by the degree to which that person is free *from* societal control—is simply impossible without putting societal limits on the freedoms of everyone else.

How common law judges and lawyers have tried, historically, to resolve this basic dilemma gives rise to the three periods of legal thought we'll explore throughout the course. In each of these three periods, the predominant style is defined by answers to these three questions:

1. Which should be afforded priority by the law: free competition or societal limitations on that freedom?

2. To what extent are the "public" and "private" separate and distinct spheres?

3. By what method should the common law develop: discovering and reasoning from settled principles or working backward from the consequences of legal decisions? 

We can trace much of the roots of liberal legal thought to the work of John Locke in the late seventeenth century. In the excerpt below, Locke addresses a core question at the heart of property law: How does any individual in society come to "own" anything?
