title: The Relative Nature of Possession
short: Relative Nature of Possession

The case study above asked you to consider both conventional and critical perspectives on the significance of transforming possession into title, in the specific context of land in African Nova Scotian communities. To better understand the legal groundwork for this debate, we now return to the basic question of what rights are afforded to someone in possession of land but who lacks formal title. *Asher v Whitlock*, below, engages the issue of what happens when two claimants—neither of whom hold title—make competing claims to land. In the course of answering that question, the Court elaborates on the rights of parties in possession. Because of the style in which some mid-nineteenth century law reports were written—presenting the lawyers at trial in dialogue with the judges, followed by the court's final judgement—*Asher* also provides an opportunity to reconnect the ideas about patterns of common law argument that we addressed in Unit 1.
