With this background in mind, we now turn to some of the central common law doctrines around possession to land. The next case, *Asher v Whitlock*, examines the question of what happens when two claimants—neither of whom hold title—make competing claims to land. In the course of answering that question, the Court elaborates on the rights of parties in possession. Because of the style in which some mid-nineteenth century law reports were written—presenting the lawyers at trial in dialogue with the judges, followed by the court's final judgement—*Asher* provides an opportunity to reconnect the arguments bites we studied in Unit 1 to the role of the classical common law style in "resolving" competing argument pairs.
