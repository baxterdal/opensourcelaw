For more than a hundred years after it was enacted, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stood as the British Crown's most authoritative statement on Aboriginal title. But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in the *St. Catherine's Milling Case* in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada's highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.

Set in the two decades after Confederation in 1867, the dispute in *St. Catherine's Milling* between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government (Canada) was nominally about which level of government held title to public lands within the geographic boundaries of Ontario that had—according to Canada's interpretation of treaty rights—been ceded to the Crown by the *Nahkawininiwak* (Salteaux) as part of Treaty 3 (the North-West Angle Treaty). In the course of trying to resolve that dispute, the common law courts pronounced on the nature of Aboriginal title in ways that had far-reaching consequences. At issue in *St. Catherine's Milling* is not the courts' interpretation of treaty rights under Treaty 3, but of the land rights that *preceded* that treaty as a matter of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title.

To understand *St. Catherine's Milling* and is implications, it is important to appreciate the context in which the question of Aboriginal title came before the courts. As Kent McNeil observes in his history of the case, "[t]he 1880s were years of adversity and deprivation for Indigenous peoples, who were facing the unrelenting advance of imperialism in various parts of the world."[^mcneil2019a] "During the same period," McNeil writes, "the taking of Indigenous lands, suppression of Indigenous political authority, and forced assimilation were also proceeding in Canada,"[^mcneil2019b] underpinned by the rising prominence of social darwinism and by westward economic expansion and resulting, among other abuses, in the creation of the residential school system.

### The Facts and Law in *St. Catherine's Milling*

The facts and law in this case are reasonably complicated. Essentially, the case involves a dispute between Ontario and Canada as to title in public lands within the political boundaries of Ontario. Understanding the factual and legal context of the case is a useful exercise in learning how to make sense of a complex case across multiple judgements. Here, I will aim to sketch the outlines of that context to help you make sense of the case.

For our purposes, the main legal dispute in *St. Catherine's Milling* turns on the interpretation of Section 109 of the *Constitution Act, 1867*. That provision reads:

> 109 All Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all Sums then due or payable for such Lands, Mines, Minerals, or Royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any Trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any Interest other than that of the Province in the same.

In effect, Section 109 says that title in any lands "belonging to" the British Crown prior to 1867 (i.e. lands not held by private interests or otherwise taken up) passed to the Province of Ontario at Confederation. The question in *St. Catherine's Milling* was therefore whether or not the lands at issue--those that would be subject to Treaty 3 after 1873--"belonged to" the Crown before 1867. 

The defendant's (St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co.) argument in the case was that these lands did *not* belong to the Crown prior to 1867, because title to those lands was held by the *Nahkawininiwak* (Salteaux) *as* Aboriginal title--a form of title recognized by the Royal Proclamation. The fact of Aboriginal title meant that the lands did not "belong" to the Crown and therefore could not have passed to Ontario by virtue of Section 109. It was this Aboriginal title, according to this view, that was later ceded to the Crown through Treaty 3. On the basis of the "beneficial interest" acquired by Canada through Treaty 3, it granted licenses to the company to engage in forestry on the lands. 

The defendant bolstered its argument about Section 109 of the *Constitution Act, 1867* by citing another provision in that same *Act*, namely Section 91(24) which refers to Canada's jurisdiction over "lands reserved for the Indians". The argument here is that lands subject to Aboriginal title fall within Section 91(24) and are consequently exempt from Section 109. 

Ontario disagreed with the defendant's interpretation of the law, arguing that "unceded" lands prior to 1867 were not held under any recognized form of common law title and therefore passed to Ontario at Confederation. This argument required Ontario to deny that Aboriginal title should be considered a recognized legal interest in land.

While the dispute in the case is one about the respective entitlements of Ontario and Canada, we are reading the judgements below in order to understand how the judges' reasons shaped the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. As it turns out, the answer to the question, "What *is* Aboriginal title and what is its *source*?" becomes central to resolving the case. At the same time, it is obvious that the Indigenous communities whose rights were at stake were not actually parties to the case. As becomes clear from the judgments, Indigenous voices and interests were entirely absent in the early development of a legal doctrine that would have such enormous significance for Indigenous nations. 

Procedurally, Ontario succeeds at trial before Chancellor Boyd in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario and in every appeal of that decision that follows. In addition to Chancellor Boyd's decision, we will read Justice Strong's dissenting judgement at the Supreme Court of Canada and Lord Watson's decision upon final appeal to the Privy Council in 1888. Each judge approaches the issue of Aboriginal title from a different perspective, and by reading these decisions together we can gain a much deeper understanding of how classical legal thought has shaped common law principles about Indigenous land rights.

### Title vs. Sovereignty

As you read *St. Catherine's Milling*, keep in mind that there are crucial differences between "legal title" (what we normally think of as "ownership", either private or public) and "sovereignty" (a nation's authority to govern itself and its citizens). In *St. Catherine's*, the question of who holds sovereignty over lands in Canada is not recognized or considered but the courts—it is assumed that the Crown legitimately has the authority to enact laws governing the land and is vested with an "allodial" or underlying title derived from its presumed sovereignty. We will come back to this important issue next week. *St. Catherine's* concerns the question of title.
