For more than a hundred years, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stood as the British Crown's most authoritative statement on Aboriginal title. But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in the *St. Catherine's Milling Case* in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada's highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.

Set in the two decades after Confederation in 1867, the dispute in *St. Catherine's Milling* between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government was nominally about which level of government held title to public lands within the boundaries of Ontario that had—according to Canada's interpretation of treaty rights—been ceded to the Crown by the Salteaux First Nation as part of Treaty 3 (the North-West Angle Treaty). In the course of trying to resolve that dispute, the common law courts pronounced on the nature of Aboriginal title in ways that had far-reaching consequences.

To understand *St. Catherine's Milling* and is implications, it is important to appreciate the context in which the question of Aboriginal title came before the courts. As Kent McNeil observes in his history of the case, "[t]he 1880s were years of adversity and deprivation for Indigenous peoples, who were facing the unrelenting advance of imperialism in various parts of the world."[^mcneil2019a] "During the same period," McNeil writes, "the taking of Indigenous lands, suppression of Indigenous political authority, and forced assimilation were also proceeding in Canada,"[^mcneil2019b] underpinned by the rising prominence of social darwinism and by westward economic expansion and resulting, among other abuses, in the creation of the residential school system.

### The Facts and Law in *St. Catherine's Milling*

The facts and law in this case are complicated. Essentially, the case involves a dispute between Ontario and Canada as to title in public lands within the political boundaries of Ontario. Understanding the factual and legal context of the case is a useful exercise in learning how to make sense of a complex case across multiple judgements. 

I suggest that you start by reading the facts as described in the report of the High Court of Ontario decision, then skip forward to read paragraphs 7-9 of Justice Strong's decision at the Supreme Court of Canada and paragraphs 1-4 of Lord Watson's decisions for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This will give you a basic outline of the case before returning to the first instance decision by Chancellor Boyd.

While the dispute in the case is between Ontario and Canada, we are reading the judgements below in order to understand how the judges' reasons shaped the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. As it turns out, the answer to the question, "What *is* Aboriginal title?" becomes central to resolving the case. At the same time, it is not inconsequential that the Indigenous communities whose rights were at stake were not actually parties to the case. As becomes clear from the judgements, their voices and perspectives were not considered by the courts.

Procedurally, Ontario succeeds at trial before Chancellor Boyd in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario and in every appeal of that decision that follows. In addition to Chancellor Boyd's decision, we will read Justice Strong's dissenting judgement at the Supreme Court of Canada and Lord Watson's decision upon final appeal to the Privy Council in 1888. Each judge approaches the issue of Aboriginal title from a different perspective, and by reading these decisions together we can gain a much deeper understanding of how classical legal thought has shaped common law principles about Indigenous land rights.

### Title vs. Sovereignty

As you read *St. Catherine's Milling*, keep in mind that there are crucial differences between "legal title" (what we normally think of as "ownership", either private or public) and "sovereignty" (a nation's authority to govern itself and its citizens). In *St. Catherine's*, the question of who holds sovereignty over lands in Canada is not recognized or considered but the courts—it is assumed that the Crown legitimately has the authority to enact laws governing the land and is vested with an "allodial" or underlying title derived from its presumed sovereignty. We will come back to this important issue next week. *St. Catherine's* concerns the question of title.
