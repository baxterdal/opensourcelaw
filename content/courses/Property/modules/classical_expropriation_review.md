Before you read and listen to the new material below, recall the case of *McLaren v Caldwell* from Week 9. In that case, the courts attempted to decide whether or not legislation passed in Ontario gave the public a right to float logs down non-navigable (and therefore "privately owned") streams. 

**Re-read paragraph 17 of [Justice Ritchie's judgement for the Supreme Court of Canada](../week9/#mclaren-v-caldwell-et-al-1882-8-scr-435).** What principle does Justice Ritchie articulate in this part of his judgement? How does he use this principle to ground his conclusion that Ontario could not have intended to expropriate McLaren's property without compensation? Could we use this principle to resolve the issue  of *de facto* expropriation in the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove caseâ€”and if so, how?
