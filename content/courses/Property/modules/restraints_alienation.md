title: Restraints on Alienation
---


In Week 7, we interpreted the issue of remedy in nuisance as an example of the fundamental dilemma facing common law courts working in the liberal tradition. In cases like *Canadian Paper Co.* and *Canadian Copper Co.*, we saw that it was impossible for one landowner to use their land freely without placing limitations on the rights of other landowners to do the same. 

Attempts to restrain alienation provide another example of this dilemma. In the cases below, the *testator* (i.e., the person making the will) attempts to place restrictions on the free alienability of property they *devise* (i.e., pass on through the will). In *Walker*, that restriction is an attempt to direct what happens to the property once the recipient under the will (the *devisee*) dies. In *Blackburn*, the testator attempts to prevent the devisees from "encumbering" (such as by mortgaging) the land for a period of twenty-five years. From the perspective of the testators in these cases, they are simply exercising their freedom to do with their property whatever they choose. But from the perspective of devisees, the testators' actions directly impair their own choices about what to do with their newly acquired property. Once again, the clash of individual freedoms is impossible to reconcile except by some application of societal interventions that weigh and determine whose interests should win out. 

As you read *Walker*, next, notice how Justice Middleton employs and interprets the concept of common law estates discussed above to reach his decision.
