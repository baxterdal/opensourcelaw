Over the course of the nineteenth century, access to waterways in Upper Canada and elsewhere in the country became an important part of the lumber industry and a primary means to bring timber from logging operations to sawmills and other points of market. In 1847, legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:[^vict1849]

> All persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.

(Here, the term "freshets" refers to the flood of a river or stream from heavy rain or melted snow). 

A question of interpretation surrounding this provision made its way before the courts in Upper Canada in a case called *Boale v Dickson*, decided in 1863. In *Boale*, the court held that the provision above applied only to watercourses that allowed timber to be floated down them "in their natural state…without improvements". Crucially, this meant that the legislation was found not apply to non-navigable rivers where riparian owners had made them navigable exclusively by installing their own improvements.

A few decades later, after the provision above was reenacted by the Province of Ontario, the decision in *Boale v Dickson* was challenged when Boyd Caldwell & Son sought to float logs down waterways belonging to Peter McLaren—waterways which McLaren had made navigable by investing in costly improvements. 

In 1880, the lumber merchant Peter McLaren persuaded the Ontario Court of Chancery to grant an injunction restraining Boyd, Caldwell & Son from using the rivers where McLaren had made improvements on the basis of the ruling in *Boale*. On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled *Boale* and overturned the injunction against Caldwell. Ultimately, the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision interpreting the 1847 Act was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada and subsequently reinstated by the Privy Council

Meanwhile, the provincial legislature attempted to intervene in the dispute by enacting legislation in 1881 entitled *An Act for Protecting the Public Interest in Rivers, Streams and Creeks* (the *Rivers and Streams Act*). This new legislation attempted to clarify that parties in Caldwell's position did indeed have the right to use rivers like McLaren's and their associated improvements, even if they were non-navigable to begin with. 

Following enactment of the *Rivers and Streams Act*, McLaren successfully petitioned the federal government in 1881 to take the extraordinary step of unilaterally disallowing the new legislation on the basis that it unduly interfered with McLaren's property rights. In the two years following, the *Rivers and Streams Act* was twice reintroduced and disallowed by the provincial and federal governments respectively. The Act finally passed, without disallowance, in 1884. 

At the heart of this dispute was the issue of how Ontario's attempts to facilitate transportation in the lumber industry ought to be interpreted in law. Should the limitations on McLaren's rights to exclude others from using the river be seen as an expropriation by the Province? What are the legal consequences of such an interpretation?

Below are excerpts from the judgements of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada in *McLaren v Caldwell*, the *Rivers and Streams Act*, and Parliamentary debates surrounding federal disallowance of the legislation.
