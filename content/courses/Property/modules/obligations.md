title: Obligations and Incommensurability
short: ''
---

One way to approach property law from an anti-colonial framework is by focussing on contradictions and conflicts rather than attempting to reconcile them. A term for this kind of focus is an “ethic of incommensurability.”[^tuckyang] Max Liboiron, a Red River Métis/Michif scholar, offers one way to understand this ethic of incommensurability in terms of conflicting obligations. Some obligations “do not share a common ground for judgement or comparison”—for example “[a]nticolonialism within dominant science. Diversity work in a racist institution.”[^liboiron] These conflicting obligations should be pursued, but not smoothed over. 

In the context of this course, an ethic of incommensurability means thinking critically about what obligations arise from teaching and learning property law in Mi’kma’ki, in a place with a long history of colonial abuses—many of which were perpetuated through the legal system. More specifically, it means focussing on some of the differences between Indigenous legal systems and the common law tradition, and not assuming such conflicts can (or should) be reconciled. 

James (sákéj) Youngblood Henderson Henderson, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and Cheyenne Nation and a legal scholar, writes about the connection between place, belonging, and obligations from an Indigenous worldview: 
> [A]n Aboriginal worldview is a spatial consciousness rather than material consciousness. Sharing and mobility discourages the accumulation of inessential resources. The sharing of space, then, is the meaning for all of Aboriginal life. The relations contained in those spaces shape both choice and placement and ultimately group life. Aboriginal people do not speak of living "there"; rather, each family or person "belongs" to the space. Belonging, then, is directly tied both linguistically and experientially to a space as well as to shared knowledge of a series of common places. Belonging to a space is more than just living in a place or using its resources; it is attendant with benefits and obligations. Belonging is viewed as a special responsibility. [^henderson]
