You might remember Darwin, also known as the IKEA monkey, who went viral in 2012 for roaming around IKEA in a stylish coat. What you might not know is that Darwin was also the centre of a legal dispute—a legal dispute which involved some of the same principles of possession present in *Clift v Kane*. 

The background to the legal dispute began when Yasmin Nakhuda purchased Darwin illegally from an exotic pet dealer. Nakhuda had been keeping the monkey as a pet for a few months when she brought him to IKEA, leaving him in a locked cage in her car while she shopped. However, Darwin escaped and wandered into the store, where he was captured by Toronto Animal Services and eventually brought to a primate sanctuary. Nakhuda sued the sanctuary to try and get Darwin back. 

One key issue in the legal case was whether or not Nakhuda lost ownership of Darwin when he escaped. To determine the answer, the court relied on a 1917 case called *Campbell v Hedley*. In that case, a fox had escaped from a fox breeder and was shot by the defendant. The court held that domestic animals “are the subject of absolute property, and the owner retains his right of property if they stray away." [^Campbell] However, in the case of wild animals—like the fox—an owner only has qualified possession unless the animal is under their complete physical control, for example if the animal is dead. In this case, the fox breeder lost his qualified possession when the fox escaped and became the defendant’s absolute possession after it was killed.

The court in Nakhuda’s case came to a similar conclusion, finding that the sanctuary was the owner of the monkey: “when the monkey ran away and Ms. Nakhuda lost possession of him, she lost ownership of him. Accordingly, she has no right to have him returned to her.” [^Nakhuda]
