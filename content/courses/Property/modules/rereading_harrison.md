title: Re-Reading Our First Case
short: Re-Reading
---

Now that you have a handle on the basic features of *Harrison v Carswell*, I would like you to read the case again. This time, try to focus on the reasons behind Justice Dickson's and Chief Justice Laskin's respective decisions.  

To help you with this task, I have colour-coded the two main argumentive structures in the case as they appear in each judge's decision. Try to think about the two judges as being engaged in a *process of argumentation* with one another. To that end, you can jump between one judge's argument and the other's corresponding counter-argument using the buttons provided in the text.

This structure of argument and counter-argument (or, symmetrical "argument pairs") captures the basic form of common law vocabulary, i.e. the way that judges, lawyers and other jurists speak to one another in their attempts to resolve legal disputes.[^kennedy1991] This concept of "argument pairs" may seem like a fairly straightforward--even obvious--one. But the simple dynamic of argument and counter-argument carries with it two very important features. First is the reality that there are only so many different argument pairs available to jurists, meaning that the common law vocabulary--complex as it might seem--actually builds on a relatively small number of highly patterned arguments. Second is the deep assumption that legal problems are actually resolved through this type of argumentative dialogue. As we move through the course this year, we will test that fundamental assumption from various perspectives. 

While you read *Harrison v Carswell* a second time keep the following questions in mind:

- Can you summarize, in your own words, the two main argument pairs in the case? 

- Why is the *Peters* case significant? 

- Why do the two judges differ in how they think the case should be resolved? Do they simply come to different conclusions based on their understandings of the facts and the law? What else might be going on? 

- Which judge's decision do you find more convincing, and why?

<!--

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is a compelling case because the issues and arguments seem so clearly to transcend those facts. The judges engage big questions about law, legal reasoning and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are objectively *better* or more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 



In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.
