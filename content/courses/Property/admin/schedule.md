This document contains the weekly class meeting schedule with a brief description of each weekly topic and a list of assigned readings for that week.

We will meet in Weldon Room 207 throughout the year. 

## Unit 1: Basics of Common Law Argument

### [Week 1 (Sept 12/14)](../../materials/week1)

**Introduction to the Course** - In our first week of class, we will cover course logistics, expectations and some core principles and practices for the year. We will then move on to look at the central framing question for the course. Finally, we will engage with the challenge of adopting an anti-colonial approach to learning and teaching property law. 

 ### [Week 2 (Sept 19/21)](../../materials/week2)

**Patterns of Common Law Argument I** - We will undertake multiple readings of our first case, *Harrison v Carswell* to gain some experience with the basic structure of common law arguments in terms of symmetric "argument pairs". *Harrison* is an ideal case to illustrate this structure of argument by two leading jurists on the Supreme Court. 

<!-- ### [Week 3 (Sept 26/28)](../../materials/week3)

**Patterns of Common Law Argument II** - In this final week of Unit 1, we will continue to investigate patterns of common law argument in a second case: *Moore*.-->

<!--## Unit 2: Classical Common Law Thought

### [Week 4 (Oct 4/6)](../../readings/week4)

**Possession I** - This week, we begin to develop the historical thread of the course, starting with an introduction to the framework we will use to study property law as a aspect of political economy in Canada over the past few hundred years. Starting in the classical style of common law thought, we will read some of the liberal beginnings of possession in Locke and see their application to the seal fishery in Newfoundland in *Clift v Kane*.

### [Week 5 (Oct 18/20)](../../readings/week5)

**Possession II** - Building on our introduction to possession, we take up a case study of unclear land titles in African Nova Scotian communities. This case study will help us to see the significances of legal distinctions between possession and title, and link the liberal foundations of possession and competition to the context of systemic discrimination and anti-Black racism in Nova Scotia today. 

### [Week 6 (Oct 25/27)](../../readings/week6)

**Possession III** - In this portion of the course, we explore some of the bases of Aboriginal title and look at how common law courts in the classical mode interpreted Indigenous land rights from the perspective of possession. This week also introduces the distinction between the content of common law Aboriginal title and questions about Indigenous sovereignty and law-making authority. 

### [Week 7 (Nov 1/3)](../../readings/week7)

**Treaties and Indigenous Legal Orders** - We shift focus this week to move beyond the internal perspective of the common law, asking how such a shift can help us to move beyond classical courts' interpretations of the Peace and Friendship Treaties. This week also sets the stage for one of the most pressing questions in the area of Aboriginal rights and title and property more generally: how can we more fully and effectively pursue development of law within a multi-juridical landscape? 

### [Week 8 (Nov 15/17)](../../readings/week8)

**Exclusion I** - The course now moves away from a focus on possession and into one of the key "sticks" in the common law ownership bundle: the right to exclude. Our entry point in the law of nuisance, and specifically the question of remedy (injunction vs damages). 

### [Week 9 (Nov 22/24)](../../readings/week9)

**Exclusion II** - Our second set of topics on exclusion concerns the right to exclude the *state* (or other private parties under state sanction). This engages the concept of "expropriation" (or *eminent domain*) and the ways in which this concept challenges the classical division between private right and public control. 

### [Week 10 (Nov 29/Dec 1)](../../readings/week10)

**Alienation** - Our final topic for the term is the right to alienate (sell or other transfer) property and the degree to which restraints on alienation have been permitted or prohibited by common law courts. 

## Unit 3: Modern Common Law Thought

### [Week 11 (Jan 12)](../../readings/week11)

**Land Use Control I** - In our first class on the modern style of common law thought, we will return to the issue of expropriation to examine how the Canadian law on *de facto* takings emerged and developed. We will use the recent controversy around the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Wilderness area in Halifax to ground our study of the legal issues and context. 

### [Week 12 (Jan 19)](../../readings/week12)

**Land Use Control II** - We continue to look at questions of land use control, this week from the perspective of the doctrine of *acquired rights*. The materials explore the question of whether acquired rights come from, and whether and how their scope can change over time.

### [Week 13 (Jan 26)](../../readings/week13)

**Homelessness and the Right to Shelter** - The right to shelter is an emerging constitutional right in Canada protected under section 7 of the *Charter*. It is a right that continues to evolve rapidly, alongside growing numbers of people experiencing chronic homelessness in Canadian cities. The ways in which the courts have constructed the right to shelter on an empirical basis linked to the availability of shelter options raises key questions about this type of heavy functionalist approach.

### [Week 14 (Feb 2)](../../readings/week14)

**Restrictive Covenants** - This week we look an another important dimensions of local land use controlâ€”this type from the perspective of "private" planning instruments in the form of restrictive covenants. We look at key requirements for creating valid covenant, and then turn to the common law's troubled history of using discriminatory covenants to exclude certain groups and the courts' use of the public policy doctrine as a response.

### [Week 15 (Feb 9)](../../readings/week15)

**Qualified Interests** - This week, we return to the doctrine of estates introduced in Week 10. Based on this prior material, we extend our terminology to classify and understand the different types of interests that may be created by *inter vivos* transfer or testamentary bequest. These aspects will then lead us back to our study of the public policy doctrine and its application to qualified interests. 

### [Week 16 (Feb 16)](../../readings/week16)

**Review** - A chance to pause the introduction of new material and review what we have covered so far in Unit 3.

### [Week 17 (Mar 2)](../../readings/week17)

**Reserve Lands** - This week we return to the materials on Indigenous land rights from Unit 2, picking up on the development of the doctrine of Aboriginal title and examining the specific structure and challenges associated with Indigenous peoples' property rights in reserve lands. 

## Unit 4: Contemporary Common Law Thought

### [Week 18 (Mar 9)](../../readings/week18)

**Back to Possession** - In order to introduce our final unit and the contemporary style of common law thought, we review the law on possession of both things and land and study its application in two recent cases.
