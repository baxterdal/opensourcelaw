This document contains the weekly class meeting schedule with a brief description of each weekly topic and a list of assigned readings for that week.

We will meet in Weldon Room 207 throughout the year. 

## Unit 1: Basics of Common Law Argument

### [Week 1 (Sept 13/15)](../../readings/week1)

**Introduction to the Course** - In our first week of class, we will cover course logistics, expectations and some core principles and practices for the year. We will then move on to our first case, *Harrison v Carswell*. 

### [Week 2 (Sept 20/22)](../../readings/week2)

**Analyzing Common Law Arguments** -  Having completed an initial read of *Harrison v Carswell* in Week 1, we will revisit this case using a more detailed framework for analyzing the typical patterns of common law argument. Notice that we're still working on understanding a single case. The aim at this point is to read deeply, not broadly.

### [Week 3 (Sept 27/29)](../../readings/week3)

**Practicing the Method** - In this final week of Unit 1, we will practice applying to method for analyzing common law arguments in previous weeks. Our case study here, a case called *Moore*, takes us back to an initial question about property and one's body from Week 1.
