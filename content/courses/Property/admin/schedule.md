This document contains the weekly class meeting schedule with a brief description of each weekly topic and a list of assigned readings for that week.

We will meet in Weldon Room 207 throughout the year. 

## Unit 1: Basics of Common Law Argument

### [Week 1 (Sept 13/15)](../../readings/week1)

**Introduction to the Course** - In our first week of class, we will cover course logistics, expectations and some core principles and practices for the year. We will then move on to our first case, *Harrison v Carswell*. 

### [Week 2 (Sept 20/22)](../../readings/week2)

**Patterns of Common Law Argument** -  Having completed an initial read of *Harrison v Carswell* in Week 1, we will revisit this case using a more detailed framework for analyzing the typical patterns of common law argument. Notice that we're still working on understanding a single case. The aim at this point is to read deeply, not broadly.

### [Week 3 (Sept 27/29)](../../readings/week3)

**Practicing the Analysis** - In this final week of Unit 1, we will practice applying to method for analyzing common law arguments in previous weeks. Our case study here, a case called *Moore*, takes us back to an initial question about property and one's body from Week 1.

## Unit 2: Classical Common Law Thought

### [Week 4 (Oct 4/6)](../../readings/week4)

**Possession I** - This week, we begin to develop the historical thread of the course, starting with an introduction to the framework we will use to study property law as a aspect of political economy in Canada over the past few hundred years. Starting in the classical style of common law thought, we will read some of the liberal beginnings of possession in Locke and see their application to the seal fishery in Newfoundland in *Clift v Kane*.

### [Week 5 (Oct 18/20)](../../readings/week5)

**Possession II** - Building on our introduction to possession, we take up a case study of unclear land titles in African Nova Scotian communities. This case study will help us to see the significances of legal distinctions between possession and title, and link the liberal foundations of possession and competition to the context of systemic discrimination and anti-Black racism in Nova Scotia today. 

### [Week 6 (Oct 25/27)](../../readings/week6)

**Possession III** - In this portion of the course, we explore some of the bases of Aboriginal title and look at how common law courts in the classical mode interpreted Indigenous land rights from the perspective of possession. This week also introduces the distinction between the content of common law Aboriginal title and questions about Indigenous sovereignty and law-making authority.
