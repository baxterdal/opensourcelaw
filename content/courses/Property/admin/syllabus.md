This document is the official course syllabus for *Property in its Historical Context* (LAWS 1015/25), Section B, in the 2022-2023 academic year. The course is taught by [Professor Jamie Baxter](https://www.baxterlab.ca) at the [Schulich School of Law](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/law.html), Dalhousie University.

## General Information

### Contact Details

Please contact me by e-mail ([jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca)) about all inquiries related to the course. My office is Weldon Room 326. 

### Administration

Information on all course requirements, procedures and schedules is contained in this [Course Syllabus](../syllabus) and the [Course Schedule](../schedule). Both of these documents are available in the [Administration](../) section of the course website. 

The [Course Schedule](../schedule) may be amended during the year as needed. Please refer to the online versions of these documents (rather than print-outs or local copies) for the most up-to-date information.

### Class Meeting Schedule

Please see the online [Course Schedule](../schedule) for details about class meeting dates and times. Our weekly meeting schedule is Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:05AM - 11:25AM.

### Class Meeting Format

In person meetings (Mondays and Wednesdays) will take place in Weldon 207. 

We will aim to hold all of our class meetings in a *hybrid* or *blended* format. This means that, when meeting in person, I plan to live stream that meeting via Zoom. Students attending via zoom are encouraged to participate actively in the meeting via the chat function. From time to time, we may conduct a meeting entirely online. 

Meetings will be recorded and available by request for those unable to attend a scheduled session in person or online (student recordings are not permitted--please see below). 

These measures are in place to improve equitable access for all students, recognizing that everyone comes to the course with their own needs and that circumstances can change, sometimes rapidly, over the course of the year.  

### Support Outside the Classroom

I want you to feel well supported in this course, both in class and outside the classroom. I recognize that this support may take different forms for different students, so please get in touch with me to discuss your needs.

As a baseline, I will hold scheduled drop-in office hours weekly on **Mondays from 1PM to 2PM**. These meetings may be in person or virtual, depending on preference and availability. 

If you have questions about the course material, **you must bring these questions to me during office hours.** As a general policy, I won't answer substantive questions about the course material by e-mail. This policy exists mainly to avoid a flood of last minute e-mails before exams, but it also pushes you to plan ahead in your studying. To get the most out of office hour appointments, plan to dedicate some time to ongoing review of the course content during the term and contact me with your questions as they arise. I know that this can be a challenge as the term gets busy, but the benefits of even 20 or 30 mins of periodic review will surprise you.

You should send the questions you'd like to discuss during office hours via email to [jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca) at least one hour prior to the office hour session you plan to attend. This lets me know that you are coming, helps you to focus your inquiries, and gives me a chance to think through your questions ahead of time.

I am also happy to schedule small group meetings if you'd like to meet in this format -- please e-mail to arrange a time.

### Communications About the Course

All communication from me to you about the course will be via an **Announcement posted on [Brightspace.](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/home/231015)** Please ensure that you have e-mail notifications enabled for Brightspace Announcements — this way, you will receive a copy of each announcement in your inbox when it is posted. I will assume that you have received and read all course information posted via an Announcement on Brightspace.

All e-mail messages to me about the course should include in the subject line the course name and a concise statement of purpose (e.g. Property: Questions for office hours). Please remember that e-mail is not an alternative to meeting with me using the procedure described above if you have questions about the course content.

## Course Materials, Goals and Expectations

### Online Casebook and Course Materials

All materials for this course are available online at [www.opensourcelaw/courses/property.](www.opensourcelaw.com/courses/property) The materials are free to access; you do not need to purchase a casebook or other materials for the course. 

Required readings for the course are assigned on a weekly basis — please consult the [Course Schedule](../schedule). Online versions of the weekly readings, posted on the course website, contain interactive elements (instructional notes, podcasts, screencasts, quizzes, etc), so please aim to read these materials on your computer or tablet when possible. <!--However, I realize that this format may not suit everyone for all purposes. Each assigned reading is also available on the website in multiple formats (Rich Text, Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF) for you to download, to markup, to add your own notes, and/or to use to make your own summaries.-->

These course materials have been created and published using an open-source model. This means that all materials (with limited exceptions, noted on the site) — including the website platform on which they are published — are available to anyone to access, copy, redistribute, remix, and build upon under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). 

### Class Slides

I may use slides in class meetings, but please do not expect these to be a substitute for taking your own notes in class. My slides, when I use them, are designed to give some visual structure to our class meetings, but they are not content heavy. You can access a link to the slides on the course website under the main heading for each set of weekly readings.

## Course Goals and Expectations

I have designed this course with two big goals in mind. 

The first goal is skills-based: you will learn to navigate and critically analyze the structure of arguments and reasoning employed by jurists (lawyers, judges and others)—mainly in the common law tradition, but also comparatively with other legal traditions. You will certainly need to learn some basic rules of property law and how to make arguments using those rules. But you will need to go beyond the rules and arguments by situating them in deeper structures and styles of legal thought. We will spend a lot of time looking at exactly how these "structures" and "styles" work throughout the course. Doing all this will require you, as the course title suggests, to develop an understanding of historical context — namely, how both the rules and patterns of common law thought have changed and are changing over time.

This leads to the second goal, which is to situate property law in the political-economic context of Canada over the past few hundred years. More specifically, I want each of you to leave this course with a thoughtful answer to the question of how property laws have created and reproduced Canada’s particular liberal market economy and its consequences for different communities and individuals.

Learning all this is hard work and this means that I have high expectations of you—both in class and on exams. I demand a lot from you because I want to prepare you as thoughtful and critical professionals, whether in law or in other pursuits. I value the diversity of experience and insight that you bring to studying law and I believe that each of you can meet these expectations and do the work.

### Class Preparation, Meetings and Methods

Your preparation for, attendance and active engagement in class is crucial for succeeding in this course. We have a limited time each week to spend together, and you are all very busy people. We want to ensure that we use the time together as effectively as possible. 

For each class meeting I ask that you:

- be well prepared, having worked through the online materials in advance of the first class each week;

- bring your computer or tablet to class if attending in person so that you can access the online materials;

- focus your attention on the material and limit any distractions as much as possible; and 

- participate actively in class discussions and exercises.

We will use a variety of teaching/learning methods to achieve the goals for this course, to keep things interesting, and to accommodate various learning styles. I ask for you patience if/when I am using a style that works for others, but not for you.

### Student Recordings

You are not permitted to record class meetings. The unauthorized use of any form of device to audiotape, photograph, video-record or otherwise reproduce lectures is prohibited. You must obtain prior written consent to any such recording. Exceptions may be granted in cases of private use for reason of accommodation.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated in this course based on **take-home, open-book examinations**. In December, there will be a ‘fail-safe’ exam. If you get a higher mark on your April exam, your April mark will be your final mark. If you get a higher mark on your December exam, the December mark will count for 30% of your final grade. The December and April exams are both open book and each will take place during a scheduled 8-hour take-home period.

All examinations will be written on computer. Further information will be sent to students from the Associate Dean’s Office. Rules governing exams are included in the *Academic Calendar*.

## University Policies

### Accessibility and Accommodations

The [Dalhousie Student Accessibility Centre (SAC)](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility.html) is responsible for administering the university-wide [Student Accommodation Policy](https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/policies/academic/student-accommodation-policy-wef-sep--1--2014.html) working across all faculties, including the Schulich School of Law. Individual professors cannot grant accommodation requests. 

Accommodation is introduced when a protected characteristic, including mental health related conditions, (as defined by [provincial human rights legislation](https://humanrights.novascotia.ca/know-your-rights/legislation)) may place you at a disadvantage compared to other students who are not affected by a [protected characteristic](https://humanrights.novascotia.ca/know-your-rights/individuals) and  if there are aspects of the design, instruction, and or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion. 

Students request accommodation prior to the start of the academic term or as soon as a barrier is identified. [Schulich School of Law Academic Regulations](https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&catalogid=119&chapterid=7644&topicgroupid=33843&loaduseredits=False) state that retro-active accommodation is not granted.
