This document is the course syllabus for **Property in its Historical Context** (LAWS 1015/25), Section C, in 2021-2022, taught by [Professor Jamie Baxter](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/law/faculty-staff/our-faculty/jamie-baxter.html) at the [Schulich School of Law,](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/law.html) Dalhousie University.

## General Information

### Contact Details

Please contact me by e-mail ([jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca)) about all inquiries related to the course. My office is Weldon Room 326. 

### Administration

Information on all course requirements, procedures and schedules is contained in this [Course Syllabus](../syllabus), the [Course Schedule](../schedule), and [Reading List](../reading-list). All of these documents are available in the [Administration](../) section of the course website. 

The [Course Schedule](../schedule) and [Reading List](../reading-list) may be amended during the term as needed. Please refer to the online versions of these documents (rather than print-outs or local copies) for the most up-to-date information.

### Class Meeting Schedule

Please see the online [Course Schedule](../schedule) for details about class meeting dates, times and locations. Based on current circumstances, we will plan to meet in person in Weldon Room 207 throughout the year. 

### Support Outside the Classroom

I want you to feel well supported in this course, both in class and outside the classroom. I recognize that this support may take different forms for different students, so please get in touch with me to discuss your needs.

As a baseline, I will hold scheduled drop-in office hours weekly on **Wednesdays from 10AM to 11AM**. These meetings may be in person or virtual, depending on preference, availability and the pandemic context. Please wear a mask to attend office hours if they are scheduled in person. 

If you have questions about the course material, **please bring these to office hours.** As a general policy, I won't answer substantive questions about the course material by e-mail. This policy exists mainly to avoid a flood of last minute e-mails before exams, but it also pushes you to plan ahead in your studying. To get the most out of office hour appointments, plan to dedicate some time to ongoing review of the course content during the term and contact me with your questions as they arise. I know that this can be a challenge as the term gets busy, but the benefits of even 20 or 30 mins of periodic review will surprise you.

You should send the questions you'd like to discuss during office hours via email to [jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca) at least one hour prior to the drop-in session you plan to attend. This lets me know that you are coming, helps you to focus your inquiries, and gives me a chance to think through your questions ahead of time.

I am also happy to schedule small group meetings if you'd like to meet in this format -- please e-mail to arrange a time.

### Communications About the Course

All communication from me to you about the course will be via an **Announcement posted on [Brightspace.](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/home/186026)** Please ensure that you have e-mail notifications enabled for Brightspace Announcements — this way, you will receive a copy of each announcement in your inbox when it is posted. I will assume that you have received and read all course information posted via an Announcement on Brightspace.

All e-mail messages to me about the course should include in the subject line the course name and a concise statement of purpose (e.g. Property: Questions for office hours). Please remember that e-mail is not an alternative to meeting with me using the procedure described above if you have questions about the course content.

## Course Materials, Goals and Expectations

### Online Casebook and Course Materials

All materials for this course are available online at [www.opensourcelaw/courses/property.](www.opensourcelaw.com/courses/property) The materials are free to access; you do not need to purchase a casebook or other materials for the course. 

Required readings for the course are assigned on a weekly basis — please consult the [Course Schedule](../schedule). Online versions of the weekly readings, posted on the course website, contain interactive elements (instructional notes, podcasts, screencasts, quizzes, etc), so please aim to read these materials on your computer or tablet when possible. However, I realize that this format may not suit everyone for all purposes. Each assigned reading is also available on the website in multiple formats (Rich Text, Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF) for you to download, to markup, to add your own notes, and/or to use to make your own summaries.

These course materials have been created and published using an open-source model. This means that all materials (with limited exceptions, noted on the site) — including the website platform on which they are published — are available to anyone to access, copy, redistribute, remix, and build upon under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). 

### Class Slides

I may use slides in class meetings, but please do not expect these to be a substitute for taking your own notes in class. My slides, when I use them, are designed to give some visual structure to our class meetings, but they are not content heavy. You can access a link to the slides on the course website under the main heading for each set of weekly readings.

## Course Goals and Expectations

I have designed this course with two big goals in mind. 

The first goal is skills-based: you will learn to navigate and critically analyze the structure of arguments and reasoning employed by jurists (lawyers, judges and others)—mainly in the common law tradition, but also comparatively with other legal traditions. You will certainly need to learn some basic rules of property law and how to make arguments using those rules. But you will need to go beyond the rules and arguments by situating them in deeper structures and styles of legal thought. We will spend a lot of time looking at exactly how these "structures" and "styles" work throughout the course. Doing all this will require you, as the course title suggests, to develop an understanding of historical context — namely, how both the rules and patterns of common law thought have changed and are changing over time.

This leads to the second goal, which is to situate property law in the political-economic context of Canada over the past few hundred years. More specifically, I want each of you to leave this course with a thoughtful answer to the question of how property laws have created and reproduced Canada’s particular liberal market economy and its consequences for different communities and individuals.

Learning all this is hard work and this means that I have high expectations of you—both in class and on exams. I demand a lot from you because I want to prepare you as thoughtful and critical professionals, whether in law or in other pursuits. I value the diversity of experience and insight that you bring to studying law and I believe that each of you can meet these expectations and do the work.

### Class Preparation, Meetings and Methods

Your preparation for, attendance and active engagement in class is crucial for succeeding in this course. We have a limited time each week to spend together, and you are all very busy people. We want to ensure that we use the time together as effectively as possible. 

For each class meeting I ask that you:

- be in class;

- be well prepared, having worked through the online materials in advance of the first class each week;

- bring your computer or tablet to class so that you can access the online materials;

- focus your attention on the material and limit any distractions as much as possible; and 

- participate actively in class discussions and exercises.

We will use a variety of teaching/learning methods to achieve the goals for this course, to keep things interesting, and to accomodate various learning styles. I ask for you patience if/when I am using a style that works for others, but not for you.

### Recordings

You are not permitted to record class meetings. The unauthorized use of any form of device to audiotape, photograph, video-record or otherwise reproduce lectures is prohibited. You must obtain prior written consent to any such recording. Exceptions may be granted in cases of private use for reason of accommodation.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated in this course based on **take-home, open-book examinations**. In December, there will be a ‘fail-safe’ exam. If you get a higher mark on your April exam, your April mark will be your final mark. If you get a higher mark on your December exam, the December mark will count for 30% of your final grade. The December and April exams are both open book and each will take place during a scheduled 8-hour take-home period.

All examinations will be written on computer. Further information will be sent to students from the Associate Dean’s Office. Rules governing exams are included in the *Academic Calendar*.

## University Policies

### Accommodations

Please note that individual professors cannot entertain accommodation requests.  

The [Student Accessibility Centre](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility.html) is Dalhousie's centre of expertise for matters related to student accessibility and accommodation. This includes accommodations related to protected characteristics within the [Nova Scotia Human Rights Act](https://humanrights.novascotia.ca/know-your-rights/legislation), and includes documented mental health conditions.
 
To request accommodation, please visit [Dalhousie's Academic Support website.](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility/accommodations-/requesting-accommodation.html). 

All requests for accommodations must be made in advance. 

If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this course (online or in-person) that result in barriers to your inclusion please contact the [Student Accessibility Centre](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility.html).
Your classrooms may contain accessible furniture and equipment. It is important that these items remain in place, undisturbed, so that students who require their use will be able to fully participate.

Students seeking special accommodation for exceptional short-term personal emergencies such as a debilitating medical situation, accident, or family crisis should consult with the Assistant Dean, Student Services as early as possible and, in all cases, in advance of a deadline or exam. Retroactive accommodation will not be granted. Circumstances may warrant consultation with the Studies Committee and a special accommodation request is not considered granted without written confirmation from the Associate Dean’s office. 

### Academic Integrity

At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all of our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect. As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all of the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity. [Read more here](http://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/academic-integrity.html).

All students must read the [University policies on plagiarism and academic honesty](http://academicintegrity.dal.ca/). Any paper or assignment submitted by a student at the Schulich School of Law may be checked for originality to confirm that the student has not plagiarized from other sources. Plagiarism is considered a serious academic offence which may lead to loss of credit, suspension or expulsion from the law school, or even revocation of a degree. It is essential that there be correct attribution of authorities from which facts and opinions have been derived. Prior to submitting any paper or other assignment, students should read and familiarize themselves with the policies referred to above and should consult with the instructor if they have any questions. Ignorance of the policies on plagiarism will not excuse any violation of those policies.

### Culture of Respect at Dalhousie

Substantial and constructive dialogue on challenging issues is an important part of academic inquiry and exchange.  It requires willingness to listen and tolerance of opposing points of view.  Consideration of individual differences and alternative viewpoints is required of all class members, towards each other, towards instructors, and towards guest speakers.  While expressions of differing perspectives are welcome and encouraged, the words and language used should remain within acceptable bounds of civility and respect.

Every person at Dalhousie has a right to be respected and safe. We believe inclusiveness is fundamental to education. We stand for equality. Dalhousie is strengthened in our diversity. We are a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness (Strategic Priority 5.2). [Read more here](http://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html).

### Student Code of Conduct

Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if students don’t follow this community expectation. When appropriate, violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal manner—perhaps through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution can’t be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute resolution.
