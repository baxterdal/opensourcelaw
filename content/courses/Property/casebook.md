## What is an "open source" casebook?

Post-secondary teachers and institutions are increasingly interested in making learning materials more accessible to students and to each other. Momentum has been building around the development of "open educational resources" (OER) that are free to access in various digital formats online and make it possible for teachers to adapt and remix content to suit their own goals, needs and styles.

One limitation of current OER models is that, while the *content* may be open and freely accessible, the various *platforms* used to host and publish that content are proprietary or difficult to set up, and they normally store content in formats that are incompatible with--or difficult to translate to--other platforms. 

The opensourcelaw.ca project envisions a fully open source platform for casebook development based on a small set of well-supported open software packages and content authoring technologies. The upshot of this vision? With a bit of dedicated investment into learning this platform, anyone could copy the "[sourcecode]((https://github.com/radish-es/opensourcelaw) )" for this casebook (in fact, this entire website) and host it independently, for free, maintaining full control over their content and maximum flexibility in design, while ensuring that all this remains in the most open and accessible formats to share and improve in the future.
