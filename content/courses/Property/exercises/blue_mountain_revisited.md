Briefly review the facts of the [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Case study we explored in Week 11](../week11/#problem-blue-mountain-birch-cove-lakes), then consider the following questions:

- Does the decision in *Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver* strengthen the Annapolis Group's claim in *de facto* expropriation against the Halifax Regional Municipality? Why or why not?

- Suppose that Annapolis Group Inc. is a land development company incorporated in the United States or Mexico. How might the results of its claim to *de facto* (or "indirect") expropriation differ if it were to make a claim under Article 1110 of *NAFA* rather than in Canada's domestic courts (which it could still do as a legacy claim until July 2022)? How would it differ under *CUSMA*?
