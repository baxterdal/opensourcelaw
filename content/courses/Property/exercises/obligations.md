title: Identifying Obligations
short: ''
---

For this exercise, start by taking some time to think of the obligations you bring to this property law course. You might want to start by thinking about what obligations bring you to class each week--what gets you out of your home and into the law school? There are some questions below to help guide your thinking. Take around ten minutes to write down all the obligations you can think of. 

- *Community*: Do you hold any obligations to your family, friends, classmates, employers (present or future), or other communities to this property law class? 

- *Place*: Do you feel any obligations relating to places you are from or have lived in? Any obligations coming from the place or spaces we are learning property law in?

- *Self*: Do you feel any obligations to yourself, your own morals or beliefs when you think about learning property law? 

**STOP: Don't read further until you have completed your initial list of obligations.**

Now think about how some of your different obligations might conflict with one another. Pick one obligation from your list and imagine that it is the only one you hold. How would you approach this course if you only had to worry about that single obligation? Would your approach change if you introduced an additional obligation from your list? How? Take another ten minutes to identify and write down any conflicts or tensions that appear once you examine your obligations in relation to one another. 

We will take some time to discuss this exercise and how it should inform our approach to the rest of the course in our class meeting this week.
