title: Land Title Clarification in African Nova Scotian Communities Case Study
short: Land Title
---


Our case study this week is described below using excerpts from two recent decisions of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. Both cases centre around provincial legislation called the *Land Titles Clarification Act*, RSNS 1989, c 250, through while individuals in possession of land can apply to have their land title "clarified"--that is, given formal legal recognition--where historical title does not exist or is uncertain. The excerpts from *Downey* and *Beals*, below, sketch the basic features of this legislation and its connection to the historical settlement of African Nova Scotian communities. 

At this point, we are not reading either *Downey* or *Beals* for the specific facts of the dispute before the courts, but for the background context they provide. As you read these excerpts, try to identify what rationales are offered by the courts for the process of land clarification. Why, according the courts' understandings, is the process of transforming possession into title important for African Nova Scotians?
