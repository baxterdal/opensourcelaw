Return to our introductory materials and review the section on Land, Property and Colonialism in this Course, especially the Key Challenges box. Take a few minutes to think about how these challenges come up in Locke’s treatise, using the passage and questions below as a jumping off point: 

> he who appropriates land to himself by his labour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of mankind […] for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated waste of America, left to nature, without any improvement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many conveniencies of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in Devonshire, where they are well cultivated (Sect 37)

* Ahistoricism: How does Locke portray Indigenous people and their legal orders in his treatise? How does he portray the transformation of land into property? 
* Invisibility: At the time Locke wrote this treatise, Britain had already established colonies in America. What assumptions does Locke rely on to justify his treatise, and how might these assumptions also work to justify British colonization? 
* Subsumation: In what ways does Locke portray his treatise as universal, despite being rooted in 17th century British Christianity? What contradictions might this supposed universality obscure? 

Keep these questions—and your answers—in mind when we return to Indigenous land rights in Week 6.
