Please read [this CBC News article,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/what-a-b-c-court-ruling-could-mean-for-halifax-park-evictions-1.6319104) published this past week, which raises the question of how *Bamberger v Vancouver (Board of Parks and Recreation)* (below) and the preceding caselaw on the right to shelter in public spaces might apply to the events surrounding evictions from municipal parks in Halifax this summer. 

Please also review the most recent statistics on homelessness in Halifax published by the [Canadian Observatory on Homelessness](https://www.homelesshub.ca/community-profile/halifax) and by the [Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia](https://www.ahans.ca/hrm-homelessness-statistics-2). 

Based on your reading of the caselaw and the facts contained in the sources above, how might advocates challenge the legality of the park evictions in Halifax? Is such a challenge likely to be successful? What barriers might the claimants encounter?
