title: Rules for First Possession
short: Rules
---

The two judges in *Clift v Kane* each argue for a particular legal rule of possession that they think appropriately resolves the dispute before them. In this case, the rule of possession determines *what action(s) is/are required by the sealers in order to establish sufficient control over the seals and thereby establish property in the seals. Key to understanding the case is a clear picture of exactly how this rule is expressed by the judges and how those interpretations differ (or not) from one another.Â 

Below, select which legal rule of possession each judge appears to favour.
