Various legal rules aim to protect a person's bodily integrity. But in some cases, a person's biological cells might be removed from their body. Consider the following question:

> *Should people continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed from their body?*

Listen to the *Radiolab* podcast below as you think about how you would answer this question and the *arguments* you would use to support that answer. You may also want to think about how you would define "ownership" in this context.

Write down your answer and bring it to class.
