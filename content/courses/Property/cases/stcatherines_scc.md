[*Chief Justice Ritchie, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, affirmed Chancellor Boyd's decision at trial. Justice Strong, whose judgement is below, wrote a dissent from the majority, arguing that Chancellor Boyd's decision should be overturned.*]

### Strong J. —

By the report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the 23rd July, 1884, made upon a reference to it of the question of disputed boundaries between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which report was adopted by Her Majesty and embodied in the Order in Council of the 11th August, 1884, the territory in which the lands now in question are included was determined to be comprised within the limits of the Province of Ontario. This decision of the Judicial Committee, whilst defining the political boundaries according to the contention of the last named province, does not, however, in any way bear upon the question here in controversy between the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario regarding the proprietorship of the lands now in dispute. The decision of the present appeal depends altogether upon the construction to be placed upon certain provisions of the British North America Act. By the 24th enumeration of section 91 of that act the power of legislation in respect of “Indians and lands reserved for the Indians” is conferred exclusively upon the parliament of Canada By section 109 of the same act,

> All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trust existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.

By sec. 92, enumeration 5, exclusive power of legislation is given to the provinces regarding the management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province, and of the timber and wood thereon.

The contention of the appellants is, that the lands now in question, and which are embraced in the territory formerly in dispute between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which have been decided by the Judicial Committee to be within the boundaries of Ontario, were, at the time of confederation, lands which had not been surrendered by the Indians, and consequently come within the definition of “lands reserved for the Indians” contained in sub-section 24 of section 91, and are therefore not public lands vested in the province by the operation of section 109. The province, on the other hand, insists that these are not “lands reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24, and claims title to them under the provision of section 109 as public lands which at the date of confederation “belonged” to the Province of Ontario.

It is obvious that these lands cannot be both public lands coming within the operation of section 109 and “lands reserved for the Indians,” and so subject to the exclusive legislative power of the parliament of Canada by force of the 24 sub-section of section 91. The “public lands” mentioned in section 109 are manifestly those respecting which the province has the right of exclusive legislation by section 92 sub-section 6. Then, these public lands referred to in sub-section 5, and which include all the lands “belonging” to the province, are clearly distinct from “lands reserved for the Indians,” since lands so reserved are by section 91 sub-section 24 made exclusively subject to the legislative power of the Dominion. To hold that lands might be both public lands within section 109 and sub-section 5 of section 92, and “lands reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24 of section 91, would be to determine that the same lands were subject to the exclusive powers of two separate and distinct legislatures, which would be absurd. […] 

It will be convenient here to notice a point to which some importance has been attached in the courts below. It is said, that the British North America Act contains no clause vesting in the Dominion the ultimate property in lands reserved for the Indians over which an exclusive power of legislation is by section 91 conferred on the Dominion Parliament, and that consequently, even though the lands now in question should be held to come within the 24th enumeration of the last mentioned section, yet as they are not vested in the crown in right of the Dominion nothing passed by the lease or license under which the appellants claim title. The answer to this objection is, first, that as this is an information on behalf of the Province complaining of an intrusion upon Provincial lands, the question to be decided in the first instance is that as to the title of the Province. To support the information the respondent must establish that these lands were vested in the Province by the British North America Act, failing which the information must be dismissed, whether the lease or license granted by the Dominion to the appellants conferred a legal title or not. If, therefore, the respondent fails in making out the title of the Province, it is not essential that the appellants should be able to show that under some particular clause of the British North America Act, the lands of which the *locus in quo* forms part were vested in the Dominion. I am of opinion, however, that the ultimate crown title in the lands described in sub-section 24 of section 91, whatever may be the true meaning of the terms employed (an inquiry yet to be entered upon), became, subject to the Indian title in the same, vested in the crown in right of the Dominion. The title and interest of the crown in the lands specified in sub-section 24 at the date of confederation belonged to it in the rights of the respective Provinces in which the lands were situated; for the reasons already given these lands were not vested in the new Provinces created by the confederation act; they must therefore have remained in the crown in some other right, which other right could only have been, and plainly was, that of the Dominion. For, having regard to the scheme by which the British North America Act carried out confederation, by first consolidating the four original Provinces into one body politic — the Dominion — and then re-distributing this Dominion into Provinces and appropriating certain specified property to these several Provinces, it follows that the residue of the property belonging to the crown in right of the Provinces before confederation not specifically appropriated by the appropriation clauses of the act, sections 109 and 117, to the newly created Provinces, must of necessity have remained in the crown, and it is reasonable to presume for the use and purposes of the Dominion. Next, inasmuch as all revenues, casual or otherwise, arising from the title and interest of the crown in “lands reserved for the Indians” (whatever may upon subsequent consideration appear to be the proper meaning of that expression) are by the effect of section 102 allotted to the Dominion, this assignment of revenue to the Dominion, according to a well understood rule of construction, implies a vesting of the land and property from which the revenue is to arise. This last mentioned construction, which is analogous to that so familiar in construing wills by which a gift of rents and profits is held to be equivalent to a gift of the land itself, was referred to with approbation in *Attorney General v. Mercer*, though its application was excluded in that case for the reason that the right of escheat there was held to be expressly vested in the Provinces under section 109, which cannot be the case as regards “lands reserved for the Indians,” over which an exclusive power of legislation is conferred on the Dominion, whatever may appear as the result of further consideration to be the proper meaning attributable to that expression.

The questions to be determined are therefore now restricted entirely to the construction to be placed on the words, “lands reserved for the Indians,” in sub-section 24 of section 91, and we are to bear in mind that whatever are the lands subjected by this description to the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion they cannot be lands belonging to the Province, since all these last mentioned lands are expressly subjected to the exclusive legislative powers of the Provinces. In construing this enactment we are not only entitled but bound to apply that well established rule which requires us, in placing a meaning upon descriptive terms and definitions contained in statutes, to have recourse to external aids derived from the surrounding circumstances and the history of the subject-matter dealt with, and to construe the enactment by the light derived from such sources, and so to put ourselves as far as possible in the position of the legislature whose language we have to expound. If this rule were rejected and the language of the statute were considered without such assistance from extrinsic facts, it is manifest that the task of interpretation would degenerate into mere speculation and guess work.

{{< spoiler text="Justice Strong's Approach" >}}In the paragraph above, Justice Strong sets out the groundwork for his approach to interpreting the nature of Aboriginal title. The judge gives priority to interpreting title based on "extrinsic facts" and "context". As you will read below, this leads Justice Strong to consider how colonial authorities in fact regarded and addressed Aboriginal title since the Royal Proclamation. Notice how directly some of this description contradicts Chancellor's Boyd's narrative in the court below. {{< /spoiler >}}

It is argued here for the appellants, that these words “lands reserved for the Indians” are to have attributed to them a meaning sufficiently comprehensive to include all lands in which the Indian title, always recognized by the crown of Great Britain, has not been extinguished or surrendered according to the well understood and established practice invariably observed by the Government from a comparatively remote period. The respondent, on the contrary, seeks to place a much narrower construction on these words and asks us to confine them to lands, first, which having been absolutely acquired by the crown had been re-appropriated for the use and residence of Indian tribes, and secondly, to lands which, on a surrender by Indian nations or tribes of their territories to the crown, had been excepted or reserved and retained by the Indians for their own residence and use as hunting grounds or otherwise. In order to ascertain whether it was the intention of Parliament by the use of these words “lands reserved for the Indians” to describe comprehensively all lands in which the Indians retained any interest, and so to include unsurrendered lands generally, or whether it was intended to use the term in its restricted sense, as the respondent contends, as indicating only lands which had been expressly granted and appropriated by the crown to the use of Indians, or excepted or reserved by them for their own use out of some large tract surrendered by them to the crown, we must refer to historical accounts of the policy already adverted to as having been always followed by the crown in dealings with the Indians in respect of their lands.

In the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent and in some decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States we have very full and clear accounts of the policy in question. It may be summarily stated as consisting in the recognition by the crown of a usufructuary title in the Indians to all unsurrendered lands. This title, though not perhaps susceptible of any accurate legal definition in exact legal terms, was one which nevertheless sufficed to protect the Indians in the absolute use and enjoyment of their lands, whilst at the same time they were incapacitated from making any valid alienation otherwise than to the crown itself, in whom the ultimate title was, in accordance with the English law of real property, considered as vested. This short statement will, I think, on comparison with the authorities to which I will presently refer, be found to be an accurate description of the principles upon which the crown invariably acted with reference to Indian lands, at least from the year 1756, when Sir William Johnston was appointed by the Imperial Government superintendent of Indian affairs in North America, being as such responsible directly to the crown through one of the Secretaries of State, or the Lords of Trade and Plantation, and thus superseding the Provincial Governments, down to the year 1867, when the confederation act constituting the Dominion of Canada was passed. So faithfully was this system carried out, that I venture to say that there is no settled part of the territory of the Province of Ontario, except perhaps some isolated spots upon which the French Government had, previous to the conquest, erected forts, such as Fort Frontenac and Fort Toronto, which is not included in and covered by a surrender contained in some Indian treaty still to be found in the Dominion Archives. These rules of policy being shown to have been well established and acted upon, and the title of the Indians to their unsurrendered lands to have been recognized by the crown to the extent already mentioned, it may seem of little importance to enquire into the reasons on which it was based. But as these reasons are not without some bearing on the present question, as I shall hereafter shew, I will shortly refer to what appears to have led to the adoption of the system of dealing with the territorial rights of the Indians. To ascribe it to moral grounds, to motives of humane consideration for the aborigines, would be to attribute it to feelings which perhaps had little weight in the age in which it took its rise. Its true origin was, I take it, experience of the great impolicy of the opposite mode of dealing with the Indians which had been practised by some of the Provincial Governments of the older colonies and which had led to frequent frontier wars, involving great sacrifices of life and property and requiring an expenditure of money which had proved most burdensome to the colonies. That the more liberal treatment accorded to the Indians by this system of protecting them in the enjoyment of their hunting grounds and prohibiting settlement on lands which they had not surrendered, which it is now contended the British North America Act has put an end to, was successful in its results, is attested by the historical fact that from the memorable year 1763, when Detroit was besieged and all the Indian tribes were in revolt, down to the date of confederation, Indian wars and massacres entirely ceased in the British possessions in North America, although powerful Indian nations still continued for some time after the former date to inhabit those territories. That this peaceful conduct of the Indians is in a great degree to be attributed to the recognition of their rights to lands unsurrendered by them, and to the guarantee of their protection in the possession and enjoyment of such lands given by the crown in the proclamation of October, 1763, hereafter to be more fully noticed, is a well known fact of Canadian history which cannot be controverted. The Indian nations from that time became and have since continued to be the firm and faithful allies of the crown and rendered it important military services in two wars — the war of the Revolution and that of 1812.

{{< spoiler text="The American Cases" >}}Next, Justice Strong goes on to discuss the American authorities on the question of Aboriginal title. Notice two things in the passages that follow. First, Justice Strong is relying on some of the very same authorities as Chancellor Boyd, but interpreting them very differently. Second, there is an important shift—or, we might say oscillation—in the passages quoted between the frame of "private" property rights and the "public" powers of Indigenous nations. To what extent is this reframing picked up by Justice Strong and what are its consequences for interpreting Aboriginal title?{{< /spoiler >}}

The American authorities, to which reference has already been made, consist (amongst others) of passages in the commentaries of Chancellor Kent, in which the whole doctrine of Indian titles is fully and elaborately considered, and of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, from which three, *Johnston v. McIntosh*, *Worcester v. State of Georgia*, and *Mitchell v. United States*, may be selected as leading cases. The value and importance of these authorities is not merely that they show that the same doctrine as that already propounded regarding the title of the Indians to unsurrendered lands prevails in the United States, but, what is of vastly greater importance, they without exception refer its origin to a date anterior to the revolution and recognise it as a continuance of the principles of law or policy as to Indian titles then established by the British government, and therefore identical with those which have also continued to be recognized and applied in British North America. Chancellor Kent, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in *Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia*, says: —

> The court there held that the Indians were domestic, dependent nations, and their relation to us resembled that of a ward to his guardian; and they had an unquestionable right to the lands they occupied until that right should be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government.

On the same page the learned commentator proceeds thus: —

> The Supreme Court in the case of Worcester reviewed the whole ground of controversy relative to the character and validity of Indian rights within the territorial dominions of the United States, and especially with reference to the Cherokee nation within the limits of Georgia. They declared that the right given by European discovery was the exclusive right to purchase, but this right was not founded on a denial of the Indian possessor to sell. Though the right of the soil was claimed to be in the European governments as a necessary consequence of the right of discovery and assumption of territorial jurisdiction, yet that right was only deemed such in reference to the whites; and in respect to the Indians it was always understood to amount only to the exclusive right of purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell. The royal grants and charters asserted a title to the country against Europeans only, and they were considered as blank paper so far as the rights of the natives were concerned. The English, the French and the Spaniards were equal competitors for the friendship and aid of the Indian nations. The Crown of England never attempted to interfere with the national affairs of the Indians further than to keep out the agents of foreign powers who might seduce them into foreign alliances. The English Government purchased the alliance and dependence of the Indian Nations by subsidies, and purchased their lands when they were willing to sell at a price they were willing to take, but they never coerced a surrender of them. The English Government considered them as nations competent to maintain the relations of peace and war and of governing themselves under her protection. The United States, who succeeded to the rights of the British Crown in respect of the Indians, did the same and no more; and the protection stipulated to be afforded to the Indians and claimed by them was understood by all parties as only binding the Indians to the United States as dependent allies.

Again the same learned writer says;

> The original Indian Nations were regarded and dealt with as proprietors of the soil which they claimed and occupied, but without the power of alienation, except to the Governments which protected them and had thrown over them and beyond them their assumed patented domains. These Governments asserted and enforced the exclusive right to extinguish Indian titles to lands, enclosed within the exterior lines of their jurisdictions, by fair purchase, under the sanction of treaties; and they held all individual purchases from the Indians, whether made with them individually or collectively as tribes, to be absolutely null and void. The only power that could lawfully acquire the Indian title was the State, and a government grant was the only lawful source of title admitted in the Courts of Justice. The Colonial and State Governments and the government of the United States uniformly dealt upon these principles with the Indian Nations dwelling within their territorial limits.

Further, Chancellor Kent, in summarising the decision of the Supreme Court in *Mitchell v. United States*, states the whole doctrine in a form still more applicable to the present case. He says:

> The Supreme Court once more declared the same general doctrine, that lands in possession of friendly Indians were always, under the colonial governments, considered as being owned by the tribe or nation as their common property by a perpetual right of possession; but that the ultimate fee was in the crown or its grantees, subject to this right of possession, and could be granted by the crown upon that condition; that individuals could not purchase Indian lands without license, or under rules prescribed by law; that possession was considered with reference to Indian habits and modes of life, and the hunting grounds of the tribes were as much in their actual occupation as the cleared fields of the whites, and this was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of all the colonies.

It thus appears, that in the United States a traditional policy, derived from colonial times, relative to the Indians and their lands has ripened into well established rules of law, and that the result is that the lands in the possession of the Indians are, until surrendered, treated as their rightful though inalienable property, so far as the possession and enjoyment are concerned; in other words, that the *dominium utile* is recognized as belonging to or reserved for the Indians, though the *dominium directum* is considered to be in the United States. Then, if this is so as regards Indian lands in the United States, which have been preserved to the Indians by the constant observance of a particular rule of policy acknowledged by the United States courts to have been originally enforced by the crown of Great Britain, how is it possible to suppose that the law can, or rather could have been, at the date of confederation, in a state any less favorable to the Indians whose lands were situated within the dominion of the British crown, the original author of this beneficent doctrine so carefully adhered to in the United States from the days of the colonial governments? Therefore, when we consider that with reference to Canada the uniform practice has always been to recognize the Indian title as one which could only be dealt with by surrender to the crown, I maintain that if there had been an entire absence of any written legislative act ordaining this rule as an express positive law, we ought, just as the United States courts have done, to hold that it nevertheless existed as a rule of the unwritten common law, which the courts were bound to enforce as such, and consequently, that the 24th sub-section of section 91, as well as the 109th section and the 5th sub-section of section 92 of the British North America Act, must all be read and construed upon the assumption that these territorial rights of the Indians were strictly legal rights which had to be taken into account and dealt with in that distribution of property and proprietary rights made upon confederation between the federal and provincial governments.

The voluminous documentary evidence printed in the case contains numerous instances of official recognition of the doctrine of Indian title to unceded lands as applied to Canada. Without referring at length to this evidence I may just call attention to one document which, as it contains an expression of opinion with reference to the title to the same lands part of which are now in dispute in this cause by a high judicial authority, a former Chief Justice of Upper Canada, is of peculiar value. In the appendix to the case for Ontario laid before the Judicial Committee in the Boundary Case we find a letter dated 1st of May 1819 from Chief Justice Powell to the Lieutenant Governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, upon the subject of the conflict then going on between the North West and Hudson’s Bay Companies, and of which the territory now in question was the scene. The Chief Justice, writing upon the jurisdiction of the Upper Canada Courts in this territory and of an act of Parliament relating thereto, says:

> The territory which it affects is in the crown and part of a district, but the soil is in the aborigines and inhabited only by Indians and their lawless followers.

There cannot be a more distinct statement of the rights claimed by the appellants to have existed in the Indians than this, and if the soil, *i.e.* the title to the soil, was in the Indians in 1819 it must have so remained down to the date of the North West Angle Treaty No. 3 made in 1873.

[…]

Then it is to be borne in mind that the control of the Indians and of the lands occupied by the Indians had, until a comparatively recent period, been retained in the hands of the Imperial Government; for some fifteen years after local self government had been accorded to the Province of Canada the management of Indian affairs remained in the hands of an Imperial officer, subject only to the personal direction of the Governor General, and entirely independent of the local government, and it was only about the year 1855, during the administration of Sir Edmund Head and after the new system of Government had been successfully established, that the direction of Indian affairs was handed over to the Executive authorities of the late Province of Canada. Further, it is to be observed, that by the terms of the 24th sub-section the power to legislate concerning Indians, as distinct from lands reserved, is expressly assigned to the Dominion Government, and this legislative power appears, by the tacit acquiescence of all the new Governments called into existence by confederation, to include the burden of providing for the necessities of the Indians, which has since been borne exclusively by the Government of the Dominion. At all events, the exclusive right of legislating respecting Indian affairs is thus attributed by this clause to the Parliament of Canada. This must include the right to control the exercise by the Indians of the power of making treaties of surrender, and since, as already shown, it is only by means of formal treaties that the Indian title can be properly surrendered or extinguished, Parliament must necessarily have the power, as incident to the general management of the Indians, of so legislating as to restrain or regulate the making of treaties of surrender which might be deemed improvident dispositions of Indian lands. If this were not so, and Parliament did not possess this power of absolute control over the Indians in respect of their dealings with their lands, the provisions of the 24th sub-section would be most incongruous and unreasonable, for in that case, whilst on the one hand Parliament would have to provide for the necessities of the Indians, on the other hand it would not have the means of restraining these wards of the Dominion Government from wasting the means of self support which their hunting grounds afforded. Then, taking into consideration this wide power of legislation respecting the Indian tribes, and seeing that it must necessarily include a power of control over all Indian treaties dealing with proprietary rights, it is surely a legitimate application of the maxim *noscitur a sociis* to construe the words “Lands reserved for the Indians” as embracing all territorial rights of Indians, as well those in lands actually appropriated for reserves as those in lands which had never been the subject of surrender at all.

To summarize these arguments, which appear to me to possess great force, we find, that at the date of confederation the Indians, by the constant usage and practice of the crown, were considered to possess a certain proprietary interest in the unsurrendered lands which they occupied as hunting grounds; that this usage had either ripened into a rule of the common law as applicable to the American Colonies, or that such a rule had been derived from the law of nations and had in this way been imported into the Colonial law as applied to Indian Nations; that such property of the Indians was usufructuary only and could not be alienated, except by surrender to the crown as the ultimate owner of the soil; and that these rights of property were not inaptly described by the words “lands reserved for the Indians,” whilst they could not, without doing violence to the meaning of language, be comprised in the description of public lands which the Provinces could sell and dispose of at their will. Further, we find from the conjunction of the word “Indians” with the expression “lands reserved for the Indians” in the 24 subsection of section 91 of the British North America Act, that a construction which would place unsurrendered lands in the category of “public lands” appropriated to the Provinces would be one which would bring different provisions of the act into direct conflict, since such lands would be subject to the disposition of the local legislature under sub-sec. 5, and at the same time it would be within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, in the exercise of its general right of legislation regarding the Indians, to restrain surrenders or extinguishments of the Indian title to such lands, and thus to render nugatory the only means open to the Provinces of making the lands available for sale and settlement. Then, there being but two alternative modes of avoiding this conflict, one by treating the British North America Act as by implication abolishing all right and property of the Indians in unsurrendered lands, thus at one stroke doing away with the traditional policy above noticed, and treating such lands as ordinary crown lands in which the Indian title has been extinguished, the other by holding that such unsurrendered lands are to be considered as embraced in the description of “lands reserved for the Indians,” it appears to me that the first alternative, which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of taking away proprietary rights, without express words and without any adequate reason, and of doing away at a most inopportune time with the long cherished and most successful policy originally inaugurated by the British Government for the treatment of the Indian tribes, is totally inadmissible and must be rejected. The inevitable conclusion is, that the mode of interpretation secondly presented is the correct one, and that all lands in possession of Indian tribes not surrendered at the date of confederation are to be deemed “lands reserved for the Indians,” the ultimate title to which must be in the crown, not as representing the Province, but in right of the Dominion, the Indians having the right of enjoyment and an inalienable possessory title, until such title is extinguished by a treaty of surrender which the Dominion is alone competent to enter into. To these considerations must be added the further and weighty reason, that the construction just indicated is most fair and reasonable, inasmuch as the Dominion, being burdened with the support and maintenance of the Indians, ought also to have the benefit of any advantage which may be derived from a surrender of their lands.

To these arguments the respondent opposes others of varying weight and importance, which may, as far as I can see, be all classed under two heads. First, it is attempted to show by reference to a variety of documents consisting of legislative and administrative acts, public correspondence and official reports, all of which I concede are quite admissible for the purpose, that the words “lands reserved for the Indians” had, at the time of confederation, acquired a well recognised secondary meaning, and that they were synonymous with Indian reserves and were confined to lands appropriated to the Indians by grant from the crown, or lands which the Indians had themselves reserved by excepting them from treaty surrenders. The answer to this is, in my opinion, very plain. It is true that these documents do show that lands so specifically appropriated to the Indians have always been treated and are to be considered as lands “reserved” for the Indians, and therefore lands comprised in the description given in the 24th subsection of section 91, but it does not follow from this that the clear and undoubted title of the Indians to their peculiar interest in unsurrendered lands is not also included in the same description. The inference would rather be against a construction which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of making a purely arbitrary distinction between the two classes of Indian property, for if it is once admitted or established that the Indians have a proprietary interest in lands not surrendered by them, a point on which there can really be no serious doubt, the same reasons which induced Parliament to throw around the minor territorial interests of the Indians in the smaller classes of reserves the powerful protection of the Dominion Government, or rather stronger reasons than these, must also have applied to their more valuable and important territorial rights in unsurrendered lands.

The other principal argument relied upon for the respondent is one derived from the supposed inconvenience which would result from the proprietary interest in this large tract of territory becoming vested in the Dominion Government. I can see no force in this. I am unable to see that any such result must necessarily, or is even likely, to follow because the proprietorship of the soil in a large tract of land situate within the confines of a particular province is vested in the Dominion, whilst the political rights, legislative and administrative, over the same territory are vested in the provincial government. Instances of such ownership by a federal government within the limits and subject to the jurisdiction of local governments, provinces, or states, are easily to be found, and it has never been suggested that any political inconvenience, or clashing of jurisdiction, has resulted from them. In all the States of the American Union, except the original thirteen and seven others formed out of cessions of territory by original States, viz.: Maine, Vermont, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi, and Texas, (which was admitted to the Union as a state already formed out of foreign territory,) the federal government was the original proprietor of the soil, and still remains so as regards ungranted lands. We may, therefore, presume that a system which has prevailed and still prevails in seventeen states of the Union, and which also exists in our own Province of Manitoba, and must likewise apply to all future provinces formed out of the North-West Territory, cannot be so incompatible with the political rights of local governments, or with the material interests of the people, as to require us to depart from the ordinary and well understood rule of statutory construction, and to ascribe to the Imperial Parliament the intention of abolishing by implication Indian titles which the crown had uniformly recognized for a long course of time, and protection to which had been expressly ordained and guaranteed by a proclamation of the king more than a century old.

The objection that the interests of the public would be prejudiced by attributing the ultimate crown title in Indian lands to the Dominion instead of to the province, seems to imply that this dispute is to be considered as a continuance of the contest respecting the provincial boundaries of Ontario and Manitoba. I cannot assent to this. The question between the two provinces was one in which the rights of two distinct political communities, each representing separate and distinct portions of the general public of the Dominion, came into conflict. In the present case we are entitled, indeed bound, to assume that in the disposal of these lands for the purposes of settlement the interests of the public, as well the public of Ontario as of Canada at large, will be as well served by the Dominion as by the province. I have already shown that the ownership by the Dominion of territory included within the limits of the province, is in no way inconsistent with the political rights of the latter as regards government and legislation. The only real question, therefore, can be and is, that as to which government has the better title to the fund to be produced by the sale of these lands, and if, in construing the statute, we are to take into consideration arguments based on the fairness and equity of giving to one government rather than to the other the title to this fund, I have no hesitation in assigning the better right to the Dominion. I see nothing inequitable or inconvenient, but much the reverse, in a construction of the statute which has the effect of attributing the profits arising from the surrender and sale of Indian lands to the Dominion, upon which is cast the burthen of providing for the government and support of the Indian tribes and the management of their property, not only in the Provinces, but throughout the wide domain of the North-West Territories, rather than upon the Provinces, who are not only free from all liabilities respecting the Indians, but are not even empowered to undertake them and cannot legally do so.

So far as arguments derived from expediency, public policy, and convenience are to have weight in removing any ambiguity which may be fairly raised with reference to the meaning of the terms “lands reserved for the Indians,” there were some invoked by the learned counsel for the appellants which, in my opinion, far exceed in weight any of the same class put forward on behalf of the respondent. Is it to be presumed that by the 109th and 117th sections of the British North America Act it was intended to abrogate entirely the well understood doctrine, according to which the Indians were recognized as having a title to the lands not surrendered by them, which had been acted upon for at least one hundred years, and which had received the express sanction of the crown in a royal proclamation, wherein the Indians are assured that, to the end that they might be convinced of the King’s justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, their lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown should be reserved to them for their hunting grounds? And is it to be supposed that this was done of the mere motion of the Imperial Parliament, without any suggestion or request from the body of delegates assembled in the conference by which the terms and plan of confederation were settled, or otherwise from this side of the Atlantic? And can that be considered a reasonable construction which would attribute to Parliament the intention to make this great change, and thus to break faith with the Indian tribes by abrogating the privileges conferred by a proclamation which they had always regarded as the charter of their rights, just as Canada was on the eve of acquiring from the Hudson’s Bay Company a large territory which would place in subjection to the new Dominion an Indian population far in excess of the aggregate of that contained in all the old Provinces together, a population which it would be of the utmost importance to conciliate, and which would be sure to be affected by any want of good faith practised towards the Indians of the Provinces? Before we can say that the language of the 24th sub-section of section 91 is to receive the interpretation contended for by the respondent, we must be prepared to answer these questions in the affirmative. This I cannot bring myself to do, but I am compelled to prefer the plain primary meaning of the words in question contended for by the appellants, according to which lands reserved for the Indians include unsurrendered lands, or, in other words, all lands reserved for the Indians, and not merely a particular class of such lands.

To the objections just mentioned it is, however, answered, that all the obligations of the crown towards the Indians incidental to their unsurrendered lands, and the right to acquire such lands and to make compensation therefor by providing subsidies and annuities for the Indians, attach to and may be performed by the Provinces as well as by the Dominion. The proper rejoinders to this have been already indicated, but may be more fully stated as follows: First, a construction which, without any adequate reason, would apportion the management of the Indians and their lands between two Governments and two sets of officers, whilst it is obvious that an administration of Indian affairs as a whole by one Government and one set of officers could alone be practicable and beneficial, would be so eccentric and arbitrary that nothing but express words could authorise it. Secondly, the Provinces are Governments of limited capacities, executive as well as legislative, and amongst the powers attributed to the Provincial Governments and Legislatures by the B.N.A. Act none can be found which would authorise such a dealing with Indians in respect of their lands. It cannot be pretended that any such power is conferred in express terms, and none can be implied, since such an implication would be in direct conflict with the only meaning which can be sensibly attached to the word “Indians” as used in the 24th sub-section of section 91, considered apart altogether from the subsequent words “and lands reserved for Indians,” by which word “Indians,” standing alone, it must have been intended to assign to the Dominion the tutelage or guardianship of the Indians and the right to regulate their relations with the crown generally, a duty which could not be properly performed by the Dominion if the tribes were liable to be beset by the Provinces seeking surrenders of their lands. On the whole, therefore, the result is that the construction contended for by the respondent, that unsurrendered Indian lands vested in the Provinces under the 109th and 117th sections, would practically annul the well recognized doctrine of an Indian title in these lands, and for that reason alone is therefore inadmissible.

It appears to me, therefore, that the contentions of the respondent entirely fail, and that were there nothing more to be said the appellants would be entitled to judgment on this appeal.

So far I have considered and dealt with the case upon the assumption that there were no extrinsic circumstances, documents, or course of conduct, from which we could derive assistance in placing a meaning upon the words of the 24th sub-section, beyond the established usage of the crown, according to which the Indians were considered as possessing the proprietary interest already referred to in their unsurrendered lands. It appears, however, that a much stronger case than this is made in favour of the construction contended for by the appellants, for we find that in the proclamation of King George the 3rd, already incidentally alluded to, which had the force of a statute and was in the strictest sense a legislative act, and which had never, so far as I can see, been repealed, but remained, as regards so much of it as is now material, in force at the date of confederation, Indian lands not ceded to or purchased by the king, *i.e.*, lands not surrendered, are expressly described in terms as lands “reserved to the Indians;” the two expressions, “lands not ceded to or purchased by the king,” and “lands reserved to the Indians,” being expressly treated as convertible terms. This proclamation was that of the 7th October, 1763, by which provision was made for the government of certain territories acquired by Great Britain by conquest during the seven years’ war, and which had been ceded by the treaty of peace concluded at Paris between France, England, and Spain on the 10th February, 1763. By this proclamation four separate governments were established, viz., those of Grenada, East and West Florida, and Quebec, and the limits of each province were defined, those of Quebec not comprising the whole territory of Canada ceded by France and being of much smaller extent than those afterwards ascribed to the second province of the same name by the Quebec Act passed in 1774. The description of the territory included in the government of Quebec erected by the proclamation is as follows: —

> First, the government of Quebec, bounded on the Labrador coast by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn from the head of that river through the lake St. John to the south end of Lake Nipissim, from whence the said line crossing the river St. Lawrence, and the Lake Champlain, in 45 degrees of north latitude, passes along the high lands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the sea; and also along the north coast of the Bay of Chaleurs and the coast of the gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres, and from thence crossing the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by the west end of the island of Anticosti, terminates at the aforesaid river of St. John.

This description, manifestly, does not include the lands now in question.

The proclamation, after declaring that the King had issued Letters Patent to the Governors of these several colonies directing the calling of general assemblies for purposes of legislation and some other provisions immaterial here, proceeds to ordain certain regulations respecting Indians and Indian lands as follows: —

> And whereas it is just and reasonable and essential to our interest and the security of our colonies that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds, We do therefore, with the advice of our Privy council, declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that no Governor or Commander in chief in any of our colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida, do presume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of survey, or pass any patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their respective Governments as described in their Commissions; as also, that no Governor or commander in Chief in any of our other colonies or plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents for any lands, beyond the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north-west, or upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians or any of them.

> And we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included within the limits of our said three new Governments, or within the limit of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company; as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved, without our especial leave or licence for that purpose first obtained.

> And we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements.

> And whereas great frauds and abuses have been committed in the purchasing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of our interests, and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians, in order therefore to prevent such irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, we do, with the advice of our Privy Council, strictly enjoin and require, that no private person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement; but if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, in some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that purpose by the Governor or Commander-in-Chief of our colony respectively within which they shall lie.

This same proclamation was the subject of judicial consideration in the celebrated case of *Campbell v. Hall*, and its effect and operation was fully considered by Lord Mansfield in his judgment in that case.

As is well known, it was determined in the case of *Campbell v. Hall*, that the king had power to legislate as regards ceded and conquered colonies, and that this identical proclamation now under consideration had the force of law in the colonies to which it applied, though it was also determined that the king, having by it ordained the calling of legislative assemblies in the several colonies mentioned, his power of legislation was thereby exhausted, and that a subsequent proclamation with reference to Grenada was of no legislative force. In the present case the importance of this proclamation is paramount, and appears to me to be by itself decisive of the present appeal. In the first place, it gives legislative expression and force to what I have heretofore treated as depending on a regulation of policy, or at most on rules of unwritten law and official practice, namely, the right of the Indians to enjoy, by virtue of a recognized title, their lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown; it prohibits all interference with such lands by private persons by way of purchase or settlement, and limits the right of purchasing or obtaining cessions of Indian lands to the king exclusively. Next, by the words “to lands which not having been ceded to or purchased by us are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid,” it indicates that “lands reserved for the Indians” was a description and definition applicable to, and indeed convertible with, unsurrendered or nonceded lands. It thus furnishes us with a key to the meaning of the words “lands reserved for the Indians,” an expression which appears to have originated in this proclamation, and it entitles us, whenever we find the same words used in a statute or public document without a context indicating that it is used in some restricted sense, to infer that it includes those rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands which it was one of the principal purposes of the proclamation to assure to them. If the effect of this proclamation as applicable to the present case stopped here it would, as it seems to me, be conclusive, for being a legislative act having the force of a statute it has never, in my opinion, been repealed, but has, so far as it regulates the rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands, remained in force to the present day. It was, therefore, in force at the date of the passage of the British North America Act, and, if I am correct in this, I am warranted in saying that in the face of its express provisions that Indian lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown shall be considered “lands reserved to the Indians,” it is impossible to reject the equivalent interpretation that lands reserved for the Indians mean lands not ceded by the Indians, which is all the appellants contend for. But this proclamation has, as it appears to me, an application far beyond that already mentioned. It not only gives us a clue to the meaning of the term “lands reserved for or to the Indians,” but it applies directly and in terms to the present lands. By the first clause of the extract from the proclamation which I have read the King declares it to be his will and pleasure to reserve under his sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all land and territory not included (1) within the limits of “our said three Governments,” (2) or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, (3) also all lands westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north west. Now this territory, of which the lands in question form part, and one controversy as to which was determined by the Order-in-Council of August, 1884, was clearly not comprised within the limits of the first Province of Quebec, as those limits were defined by this proclamation of October, 1763, nor was it included within the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, nor did it lie to the west or north-west of the sources of the rivers falling into the Atlantic ocean. Then, what were the lands not included within the three Governments, nor within the Hudson’s Bay territory, to which the proclamation refers as being thereby reserved for the Indians? Clearly it has reference to the residue of the territories mentioned at the outset of the proclamation, viz., the “countries and islands ceded and confirmed to us by the said treaty.” And if this is correct, and I fail to see how it can be otherwise, this identical tract of territory now in question was, by this proclamation, which in *Campbell v. Hall* was adjudged to have legislative force, reserved to and set apart for the use of the Indians, and this provision of the proclamation, never having been repealed, nor in any way derogated from by any subsequent legislation, remained in full force as a subsisting enactment up to the passing of the confederation act. In other words, it is a legislative act, applying directly to the lands now in question, assuring to the Indians the right and title to possess and enjoy these lands until they thought fit of their own free will to cede or surrender them to the crown, and declaring that, until surrender, the lands should be reserved to them as their hunting grounds, and being still in full force and vigor when the British North America Act was passed, it operated at that time as an express legislative appropriation of the land now in dispute for the use and benefit of the Indians by the designation of “lands reserved to the Indians.” Therefore the effect of the 24th sub-section of section 91 of the British North America Act upon these lands, as lands “reserved to the Indians” by the proclamation, must be precisely the same as if, by an act of Parliament passed the day before the British North America Act, it had been declared that these same lands, designated by some appropriate description, should be “reserved to the Indians,” in which case it could hardly be pretended that they were not lands “reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24 of section 91, but public lands belonging to the Province under sections 109 and 117 and subject to the exclusive legislation of the Province under sub-section 5 of section 92.

[…]

I now proceed to consider the objections which have been made on behalf of the respondent to the arguments based on the Proclamation of 1763. First, it is said that the proclamation was wholly repealed by the Quebec Act passed in 1774. To this proposition I cannot assent. The proclamation had made provision for the civil government of the Province of Quebec, which was created by it, and it had defined the boundaries of that Province; and it was these provisions, and these only, which were repealed, altered, or in any way affected by the act of 1774. The repealing section, which is the fourth, is as follows;

> And whereas the provisions made by the said proclamation in respect of the civil government of the said Province of Quebec and the powers and authority given to the Governor and other civil officers of the said Province, by the grants and commissions issued in consequence thereof, have been found by experience to be inapplicable to the state and circumstances of the said Province, the inhabitants whereof amounted at the conquest to above 65,000 persons professing the religion of the Church of Rome and enjoying an established form of constitution and system of laws by which their persons and property had been protected, governed and ordered for a long series of years, from the first establishment of the said Province of Canada. Be it therefore further enacted: That the said proclamation, so far as the same relates to the said Province of Quebec and the commission under the authority whereof the Government of the said Province is at present administered, and all and every the ordinance and ordinances made by the Governor and Council of Quebec for the time being relative to the civil government and administration of justice in the said Province, and all commissions to judges and other officers thereof, be and the same are hereby revoked, annulled and made void from and after the 1st day of May, 1775.

From the wording of this section, as well that portion of it which consists of preamble as the enacting clause itself, it is plain that the intention was only to revoke so much of the proclamation as had relation to the civil government, the powers given to the governor, and other civil officers, and to the administration of justice in the Province. By the proclamation the law of England had been introduced into the new Province erected by the King out of the territory ceded by France. This had proved a cause of great dissatisfaction to the French Canadian population, and had, as the fourth section recites, “been found upon experience to be inapplicable to the state and circumstances of the Province.” One principal object of the act was to remedy this grievance by providing (as it did) that in controversies as to property and civil rights the laws of Canada should be the rule of decision. The proclamation had also provided for the calling of legislative assemblies; such assemblies being considered unsuited to the state of the Province, this provision was also superseded by enacting that the legislative power should be vested in a council composed of members appointed by the crown.

Further, the act greatly enlarged the boundaries of the Province, extending them westward to the Mississippi (as I may now venture to say) and southward to the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi. It was this last provision which principally attracted attention to the measure in England, and led to great debates in Parliament, and particularly to the vigorous opposition of Mr. Burke, then the agent of the Province of New York.. This extension of the limits of the Province was, as is well known, induced by considerations of policy connected with the discontent then prevailing in the adjoining English Provinces, whose people greatly objected to the act and considered themselves much aggrieved by its passage.

It is nowhere suggested that anything connected with the questions of Indians or Indian rights led to this enactment. None of the changes in the terms of the proclamation which were introduced by the act have the most remote bearing on Indian land rights or Indian affairs. Neither the establishment of French instead of English law, nor the substitution of a council for an assembly, nor the enlargement of the Provincial boundaries, can by implication have any such effect, and the act does not contain a word expressly referring to the Indians. Further, the third section of the act contains an express saving of titles to land, in words sufficiently comprehensive to include the Indian title recognized by the proclamation. Its words are:

> Nothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to make void, or to vary, or alter, any right, title or possession derived under any grant, conveyance or otherwise howsoever, of or to any lands within the said province or the provinces thereto adjoining; but that the same shall remain and be in force and have effect as if this act had never been made.

The words “right,” “title” and “possession” are all applicable to the rights which the crown had conceded to the Indians by the proclamation, and, without absolutely disregarding this 3rd section, it would be impossible to hold that these vested rights of property or possession had all been abolished and swept away by the statute. I must therefore hold, that the Quebec act had no more effect in revoking the five concluding paragraphs of the proclamation of 1763 which relate to the Indians and their rights to possess and enjoy their lands until they voluntarily surrendered or ceded them to the crown, than it had in repealing it as a royal ordinance for the government of the Floridas and Granada.

Then it is said that the proclamation was, as regards the Indians, merely a temporary measure, and that its character as such is evidenced by the introductory words to the clauses now material: “and we do further declare it to be our Royal will and pleasure *for the present*.” There is no force in this point unless it can be shown that the proclamation was revoked in a regular and constitutional manner. A statute which makes provision “for the present,” without any express limit in point of time, or other indication by which its duration can be ascertained, remains in force until it is repealed. As I have already said, we are bound to regard this proclamation as having all the force of a statute, and as such it must be subject to the established rules of statutory construction. No act of Parliament, Order in Council, or Colonial statute or ordinance can be produced repealing, or assuming to repeal, so much of its terms as are applicable to the present question. We are therefore bound to conclude that, to the extent just indicated, it remained in full force and operation, and had all the effect of an act of Parliament, up to the passing of the British North America Act in 1867.

That the proclamation was not considered by the government and its officers to have been superseded by the Quebec Act, or otherwise, is shown by the strict observance of its terms in all dealings with the Indians respecting their lands. The Indians themselves have been allowed to consider it as still of binding force, and to look upon it as the charter of their rights. In the report of the Indian commissioners appointed by the government of Canada, dated the 22nd January, 1844, and therefore made whilst the Indians were still under the protection of the Imperial Government, it is said:

> The subsequent proclamation of His Majesty George Third, issued in 1763, furnished them with a fresh guarantee for the possession of their hunting grounds and the protection of the crown. This document the Indians look upon as their charter. They have preserved a copy of it to the present time, and have referred to it on several occasions in their representations to the government.

> Since 1763 the government, adhering to the royal proclamation of that year, have not considered themselves entitled to dispossess the Indians of their lands without entering into an agreement with them and rendering them some compensation. For a considerable time after the conquest of Canada the whole of the western part of the upper province, with the exception of a few military posts on the frontier and a great extent of the eastern part, was in their occupation. As the settlement of the country advanced and the land was required for new occupants, or the predatory and revengeful habits of the Indians rendered their removal desirable, the British government made successive agreements with them for the surrender of portions of their lands.

It is not suggested that between 1844 and the passage of the British North America Act anything occurred to detract from Indian rights. This constant usage for upwards of a century by itself raises a strong presumption in favour of the construction of the Quebec Act which I maintain, namely, that it had not the repealing effect contended for by the respondent. Further, in the case of *Johnson v. McIntosh*, decided in 1823, the Supreme Court of the United States had to deal directly with this identical point of the binding effect, as a legislative ordinance, of the proclamation of 1763, and with its operation at a date subsequent to the Act of 1774 upon Indian lands included within the boundaries of the second province of Quebec created by that act. The lands there in question were within the territory, which, by the Treaty of Versailles (1783) settling the boundaries between Canada and the United States, became part of the United States and was known as the Territory of Illinois, and these lands had been purchased from the Indians in 1775 and 1778 in contravention of the terms of the proclamation. It was objected that the title so acquired was thereby rendered void. Chief Justice Marshall, in giving the judgment of the court, says:

> The proclamation issued by the King of Great Britain in 1763 has been considered, and we think with reason, as constituting an additional objection to the title of the plaintiff.

The Chief Justice then proceeds to consider the constitutional validity of the proclamation, which he recognises to have been well established by *Campbell v. Hall*, and upon that, as well as upon other grounds, he gives judgment against the title. Now, if the Quebec Act, which, as it was a statute preceding in date the Declaration of Independence (1776), would have been considered in this respect binding by the American Courts, had repealed the proclamation, the Supreme Court would have been wrong in its conclusion that it applied to the case before them. It is out of the question to suppose that the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, several of whom were contemporaries of the revolution and actors in it (notably the Chief Justice himself), were not perfectly familiar with a statute so notorious throughout the old colonies as the Quebec act, which had been one of the pretended grievances set forth in the Declaration of Independence by way of justifying the revolution. We must therefore conclude that it was considered by the court not to repeal or in any way affect the provisions of the proclamation relating to the Indians. Lastly, the learned Chancellor himself, in his judgment in this case, concedes that “the proclamation has frequently been referred to by the Indians themselves as the charter of their rights;” and, speaking of the clause “relating to the manner of dealing with them in respect of lands they occupy at large or as a reserve,” he says it “has always been scrupulously observed in such transactions,” but still he adds that it had been repealed by the Quebec act and had become obsolete. That so much of it as is now material was not repealed by the Quebec act, according to the proper construction of that statute, I have, I think, sufficiently established; and that it could otherwise have become legally obsolete was impossible, since, if *Campbell v. Hall* is to be considered sound law, it was a legislative ordinance of equivalent force with a statute, and consequently could only have been repealed by an act emanating from some competent legislative authority; but no such act can be referred to. That the proclamation ever in fact became practically obsolete from desuetude, is so far from having been the case that it is admitted to have remained since the act of 1774 “operative as a declaration of sound principles which then and thereafter guided the executive in disposing of Indian claims.”

But even if I am wrong in my view that the statute of 1774 had not the effect contended for, but that the proclamation was in point of law wholly revoked by it, there still remains the argument that its terms furnish a key to the meaning of the words used in the 24th subsection of section 91 of the British North America Act, upon the construction of which the decision to this appeal must wholly depend. Thus, using the text of the proclamation as a glossary, we find that in 1763 lands reserved for the Indians meant lands not ceded or surrendered by them to the crown. Then, as we find it generally admitted, that this proclamation, even if superseded, has down to the present time been regarded by the Indians as the charter of their rights, that it has remained operative as a declaration of sound principles, and that its terms have always been scrupulously observed in dealings with the Indians in respect of their lands (all of which are very nearly the learned Chancellor’s own words), the result is inevitable, that the expression “lands reserved for the Indians” employed in the proclamation retained its original significance as an equivalent for lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown down to 1867 when the British North America Act was passed, and that, consequently, when the same words were made use of in the 91st section of that act, it was with the intention that they should receive the same definite and well understood meaning as had always been thus attached to them.

Some stress has been laid on the legislation of the Dominion since confederation, as indicating that the Parliament of Canada has adopted the construction of the British North America Act contended for by the respondent. Even if this had been so, I am not aware of any principle upon which what may be considered an erroneous view adopted by Parliament of this question of the meaning of sub-section 24 of section 91 could bind this court to adopt the same construction in a judicial decision, although, if there was room for doubt and there had in fact been any legislation, it would, as embodying the opinion of Parliament as to the proper interpretation of the Imperial act, be entitled to some, though not conclusive, weight and influence. It does not appear, however, that any such construction as is contended for by the respondent has, in fact, been placed by Parliament on the 24th sub-section of section 91. Three acts relating to the Indians and Indian lands have been passed by the Parliament of Canada since confederation, in 1868, 1876, and 1880 respectively. In the first of these statutes (31 Vic. ch. 42), an act organizing the Department of the Secretary of State, by section 6 all lands reserved for Indians, or for any tribe, band, or body of Indians, are declared “to be deemed reserved for the “same purposes as before the act,” and by section 8 it was provided, that lands reserved for the use of the Indians should only be ceded to the crown by a formal treaty of surrender made in the manner prescribed by the act, and that until surrender no sale or lease of Indian lands should be valid. In the subsequent acts of 1876 and 1880, the same provisions were repeated, except that the word “reserves” was used instead of “lands reserved for the Indians,” and by an interpretation clause it was declared that the term “reserve” meant “any tract of land set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit, or granted to a particular band of Indians, of which the legal title is in the crown but which is unsurrendered.” With regard to these acts it is to be observed that in the first act the identical expression calling for interpretation, “lands reserved for the Indians,” is used. In the second and third, the word “reserves” has been substituted, and what I understand to be contended is, that this word “reserves,” with the meaning affixed to it by the interpretation clause, has a narrower signification than one which includes all unsurrendered lands. I am not prepared so to understand the word “reserves” as defined by the interpretation clause, for I cannot admit that it has a less comprehensive signification than the words “lands reserved for the Indians” in the Act of 1868, and these latter words must receive the same construction as is to be attributed to precisely the same words as used in the British North America Act. But, conceding that the word “reserves” did apply to Indian lands of a different class from those referred to as “lands reserved for the Indians,” what possible effect could that have on the present question, which is confined to the construction of an Imperial statute — the confederation act? That Parliament has no power to divest the Dominion in favour of the Provinces of a legislative power conferred on it by the British North America Act is, I think, clear. But, assuming that it had, it has neither assumed to put forth any authoritative declaration of the proper construction of the clause in question in the British North America Act, or to relinquish in favour of the provinces any right of property or power of legislation vested in the Dominion by its provisions. At most, if my construction of the word “reserves” is erroneous, it could be said, that, having the power to legislate for all lands occupied by and not surrendered by Indians, Parliament had only seen fit to exercise this power in relation to the class of lands comprised in the description of “reserves” as defined by the interpretation clause, but on no principle that I ever heard or read of could this be said either to imply an authoritative declaration of the construction of the British North America Act binding on the courts, or a relinquishment in favour of the provinces of the exclusive right of legislation regarding lands reserved for the Indians, or a cession to the provinces of the rights of the crown in such lands. These statutes have, therefore, no application to the question the court is called upon to decide on this appeal.

On the whole my conclusion must be, that the lands included in the description of “lands reserved for the Indians,” in subsection 24 of section 91 were not vested in the provinces as public lands or property by sections 109 and 117, and that all lands occupied by Indians and not ceded by them to the crown are comprehended in the exclusive powers of legislation conferred on the Dominion, and that the ultimate property in such lands, subject to the Indian title, is vested in the crown for the use of the Dominion; that consequently the North-West Angle Treaty No. 3 conferred an absolute title to the lands in question in this case on Her Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada; and that this appeal must be allowed and the information dismissed in the court below with costs in all the courts.

*Appeal dismissed with costs*.
