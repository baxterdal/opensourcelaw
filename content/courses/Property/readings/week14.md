## Introduction ##

For the past three weeks we have examined, from various angles, the way public authorities—mainly, local governments in the urban context—regulate and control the use of both private and public land. We noted, at the beginning of [Week 11](../week11/), that modern, forward-looking land use planning and zoning regimes emerged in Canada by the mid-20th century to replace more decentralized and reactive forms of land-use control, such as private nuisance actions adjudicated by the common law courts (which we studied in [Week 8](../week8/) of the course).

This story about the move from private nuisance actions to public land-use controls, however, needs to be complicated a little further. Certain "private" forms of land-use regulation are still in widespread use. One of the most pervasive—but often least noticed—is the *restrictive covenant*. 

From one point of view, restrictive covenants look like a fairly straightforward promise by one landowner to another—a promise to refrain from doing something on one's own land. One landowner might promise not to cut down the trees in their yard, for example, or promise not to paint their house a garish shade of bright green. But from a legal perspective, restrictive covenants are much more than this. Not only do covenants represent a sort of contractual promise between parties, they help to define the durable "bundle of rights" in the land itself—that is, covenants are said to *run with the land* and can, at least in theory, long outlast the original parties to the covenant. As discussed below, this possibility raises some difficult questions for courts in how they define the basic character of covenants along with their consequences.

This week, we will study one specific issue with respect to restrictive covenants: what distinguishes a valid, enforceable covenant from an invalid (and therefore unenforceable) one? Part of this determination, as we will see, turns on a set of formal criteria for establishing a valid covenant. But validity can also be determined through an analysis of the various extrinsic reasons why courts might refuse to enforce an otherwise valid covenant. Here, we will focus mainly on the grounds of "public policy" as a reason for refusing to enforce covenants found to be discriminatory or against other foundational values. 

## Problem: Restrictive Covenants ##

{{< figure src="/media/housing_sign.jpg" caption="Sign on a traffic post at the Robie Street / Willow Tree intersection in Halifax." >}}

Please listen to this recent [NPR Radio documentary about 3000 Funston Street,](https://www.kut.org/austin/2021-09-10/west-austin-affordable-housing-lawsuit) a piece of vacant land in the Brykerwoods neighbourhood of Austin, Texas. The podcast tells the story of how a restrictive covenant is shaping urban development in the context of the city's long-term strategy to improve access to affordable housing and achieve a more equitable distribution of that housing across the municipality. If you prefer, the website also contains a print version of the radio documentary.  

The provisions of the restrictive covenant at 3000 Funston Street are included on the website — they are as follows:

> All lots in Brukenwoods Annex shall be subject to the following restrictions, covenants and conditions:
>
> 1. All lots in the tract shall be known and described as residential lots. No structures shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any residential building plot other than one detached single family residence, or one duplex apartment, except that private garages for not more than three cars may be constructed and may be attached to or detached from the main residence structure, and servants quarters or one garage apartment Amy be constructed only after the main residence structure is completed.
>
> 2. No building shall be located on any residential building plot near than 25 ft. to the front lot line, no nearer than 12 ft. to any side street line. No building except a garage or other out-building located 90 ft. or more from the front lot line shall be located nearer than 5 ft. To any side lot line.
>
> 3. No residential structure shall be erected or placed on any building plot, which lot has an area of less than 5750 square ft. or a width of less than 50 ft. at the front building setback line as shown on the recorded plat.
>
> 4. No noxious or offensive trade or activity shall be carried on upon any lot, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become and annoyance or nuisance to the neighbourhood.
>
> 5. No persons of any race other than the white race shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupant by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.
>
> 6. No trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn or other out-building erected in the tract shall ay any time be used as a residence temporarily or permanently, nor shall any structure of a temporary character be used as a residence. 
>
> 7. The ground floor area on the main residence structure erected on any building plot shall not be less than 750 square feet for Lots 1 to 16 inclusive, and not less than 850 square feed for Lots 17 to 21, inclusive each being exclusion of one stray open porches and garage.
>
> 8. These covenants are to run with the land and shall be binding on all parts and all persons claiming under them until January 1, 1966 at which time aside covenants shall be auto magically extended for successive periods of ten years unless by vote of the majority of the then owners of the lots it is agreed to change the said covenants in whole or in part. 
>
> 9. If the parties hereto or any of them or their heirs or assigns shall violate or attempts to violate any of the covenants herein, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons owning any real property situated in said development or subdivision to prospector any proceedings at law or in equity against the person or person violating or attempting to violate any such covenant and whether to prevent him or them from so doing or to recover damages or other dues for such violations.
>
> 10. Invalidation of any one of these covenants by judgement or court order shall in no wise affect any of the other provisions which shall remain in full force and effect. 

As we will see below in relation to *Re Drummond Wren* and *Re Noble and Wolf v Alley*, legal systems in both Canada and the United States have a long, troubling history of upholding the type of racially restrictive covenants seen in Clause 5 of the 3000 Funston Street covenant. These clauses are no longer enforceable in Canadian law (though in some places, like this [West Vancouver neighbourhood,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/land-covenants-1.5442686) such clauses formally remain on title).

Suppose that the facts surrounding 3000 Funston Street take place in a Canadian city like Halifax. Which provisions of the restrictive covenant above might limit the use of the land for the development of affordable housing as envisioned by the City of Austin? Would such provisions be valid and enforceable under the legal rules and doctrines we are studying this week?

## *Tulk v Moxhay* (1848), 41 ER 1143 (Ch) ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Tulk.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Tulk.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Tulk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

*In the year 1808 the Plaintiff, being then the owner in fee of the vacant piece of ground in Leicester Square, as well as of several of the houses forming the Square, sold the piece of ground by the description of "Leicester Square garden or pleasure ground, with the equestrian statue then standing in the centre thereof, and the iron railing and stone work round the same," to one Elms in fee: and the deed of conveyance contained a covenant by Elms, for himself, his heirs, and assigns, with the Plaintiff, his heirs, executors, and administrators, "that Elms, his heirs, and assigns should, and would from time to time, and at all times thereafter at his and their own costs and charges, keep and maintain the said piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing round the same in its then form, and in sufficient and proper repair as a square garden and pleasure ground, in an open state, uncovered with any buildings, in neat and ornamental order; and that it should be lawful for the inhabitants of Leicester Square, tenants of the Plaintiff, on payment of a reasonable rent for the same, to have keys at their own expense and the privilege of admission therewith at any time or times into the said square garden and pleasure ground."*

*The piece of land so conveyed passed by divers mesne conveyances into the hands of the Defendant, whose purchase deed contained no similar covenant with his vendor: but he admitted that he had purchased with notice of the covenant in the deed of 1808.*

*The Defendant having manifested an intention to alter the-character of the square garden, and asserted a right, if he thought fit, to build upon it, the Plaintiff, who still remained owner of several houses in the square, filed this bill for an injunction; and an injunction was granted by the Master of the Rolls to restrain the Defendant from converting or using the piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing round the same, to or for any other purpose than as a square garden and pleasure ground in an open state, and uncovered with buildings.*

*On a motion, now made, to discharge that order, Mr. R. Palmer, for the Defendant, contended that the covenant did not run with the land, so as to be binding at law upon a purchaser from the covenantor, and he relied on the dictum of Lord Brougham C. in Keppell v. Bayley (2 M. & K. 547), to the effect that notice of such a covenant did not give a Court of Equity jurisdiction to enforce it by injunction against such purchaser, inasmuch as "the knowledge by an assignee of an estate, that his assignor had assumed to bind others than the law authorised him to affect by his contract-had attempted to create a burthen upon property which was inconsistent with the nature of that property, and unknown to the principles of the law-could not bind such assignee by affecting his conscience." In applying that doctrine to the present case, he drew a distinction between a formal covenant as this was, and a contract existing in mere agreement, and requiring some further act to carry it into effect; contending that executory contracts of the latter description were alone such as were binding in equity upon purchasers with notice; for that where the contract between the parties was executed in the form of a covenant, their mutual rights and liabilities were determined by the legal operation of that instrument, and that if a Court of Equity were to give a more extended operation to such covenant, it would be giving the party that for which he had never contracted. He admitted, indeed, that the decisions of the Vice-Chancellor of England in Whatman v. Gibson (9 Sim. 196) and Schreiber v. Creed (10 Sim. 35) were not reconcileable with that doctrine; but he referred to the present Lord Chancellor's order, on appeal, in Mann v. Stephens (15 Sim. 379), as apparently sanctioning it by the liberty there given to the Plaintiff to bring an action, from which it was to be inferred that his Lordship thought that the right of the Plaintiff to relief in equity depended upon, and was commensurate with, his right of action upon the covenant at law.*

**The Lord Chancellor (Cottenham)** :—

[1] That this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a contract between the owner of land and his neighbour purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is what I never knew disputed. Here there is no question about the contract: the owner of certain houses in the square sells the land adjoining, with a covenant from the purchaser not to use it for any other purpose than as a square garden. And it is now contended, not that the vendee could violate that contract, but that he might sell the piece of land, and that the purchaser from him may violate it without this Court having any power to interfere. If that were so, it would be impossible for an owner of land to sell part of it without incurring the risk of rendering what he retains worthless. It is said that, the covenant being one which does not run with the land, this Court cannot enforce it; but the question is, not whether the covenant runs with the land, but whether a party shall be permitted to use the land in a manner inconsistent with the contract entered into by his vendor, and with notice of which he purchased. Of course, the price would be affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more inequitable than that the original purchaser should be able to sell the property the next day for a greater price, in consideration of the assignee being allowed to escape from the liability which he had himself undertaken.

[2] That the question does not depend upon whether the covenant runs with the land is evident from this, that if there was a mere agreement and no covenant, this Court would enforce it against a party purchasing with notice of it; for if an equity is attached to the property by the owner, no one purchasing with notice of that equity can stand in a different situation from the party from whom he purchased. There are not only cases before the Vice-Chancellor of England, in which he considered that doctrine as not in dispute; but looking at the ground on which Lord Eldon disposed of the case of *The Duke of Bedford v. The Trustees of the British Museum*(2 My. & K. 552), it is impossible to suppose that he entertained any doubt of it. In the case of *Mann v. Stephens* before me, I never intended to make the injunction depend upon the result of the action: nor does the order imply it. The motion was, to discharge an order for the commitment of the Defendant for an alleged breach of the injunction, and also to dissolve the injunction. I upheld the injunction, but discharged the order of commitment, on the ground that it was not clearly proved that any breach had been committed; but there being a doubt whether part of the premises on which the Defendant was proceeding to build was locally situated within what was called the Dell, on which alone he had under the covenant a right to build at all, and the Plaintiff insisting that it was not, I thought the pendency of the suit ought not to prejudice the Plaintiff in his right to bring an action if he thought he had such right, and, therefore, I give him liberty to do so.

[3] With respect to the observations of Lord Brougham in *Keppell v. Bailey*, he never could have meant to lay down that this Court would not enforce an equity attached to land by the owner, unless under such circumstances as would maintain an action at law. If that be the result of his observations, I can only say that I cannot coincide with it.

[4] I think the cases cited before the Vice-Chancellor and this decision of the Master of the Rolls perfectly right, and, therefore, that this motion must be refused, with costs.

### Courts of Equity and Equitable Jurisdiction

To date, we have not had much to say about distinctions between "common law" and "equity" in our course—though you have likely encountered this distinction elsewhere in law school so far. Historically, the divide between common law and equity referred to the adjudication of disputes in separate and distinct courts, which differed in both the types of cases they decided and the content of the legal doctrines they applied. Today, these institutional divisions have been consolidated under the jurisdiction of the superior courts, but doctrinal distinctions remain between "legal" and "equitable" principles that are significant for understanding the operation of property law.

Two aspects of equity are especially relevant to interpreting the reasoning in *Tulk v Moxhay*. First is the idea that equity aims to supplement common law principles rather than displace or contradict them. In practical terms, this often means that a turn to equity is driven by a desire on the part of judges to soften the harder edges of the common law. Second is the idea that equity—being derived from "courts of conscience"—can only act on relationships between specific people (rights *in personum*), not directly on property rights, which are understood to be relationships between an owner and the rest of the world in general (rights *in rem*). 

The upshot of all this for understanding *Tulk v Moxhay* is that, by using equitable principles to enforce the restrictive covenant at issue, the Court does not understand itself to be modifying or affecting property rights directly but merely intervening to ensure that a person who purchases servient land with notice of a covenant cannot escape the consequences based on the somewhat formal justification that they were not parties to the original agreement. Because the downstream owner had notice, they implicitly—if not on contractual grounds—agreed to be bound by its terms.

## Public Policy ##

Even where restrictive covenants meet the formal requirements to run with the land described above, there may be circumstances in which the terms of a covenant will be rendered invalid. The courts in *Re Drummond Wren* and *Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley*, below, address two of these circumstances. 

In the first, a court might render invalid and unenforceable a restrictive covenant that is against public policy. In *Re Drummond Wren*, the court was willing to strike down a discriminatory restrictive covenant—similar to the one attached to 3000 Funston Street—on this basis. But in the subsequent case of *Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley* addressing a restrictive covenant with substantially the same terms—decided just a few years later—the courts refused to rely on grounds of public policy.

In the second circumstance, a court might find that a restrictive covenant is a prohibited attempt to restrain alienation. The approach takes us back to our discussion of restraints on alienation in [Week 10.](../week10/) From one perspective, this second grounds might be regarded as a subset of the first, based on the public policy and public interest in ensuring the free alienability of property rights. 

How could the doctrine of public policy be applied to the restrictive covenant in our case study at 3000 Funston Street for this week? Is it likely that the restrictions preventing the city from building affordable housing on the site might be found invalid according to this doctrine? On some other grounds?

As you read the cases below to understand the contours of the doctrine of public policy as applied to restrictive covenants, consider again the features of the modern style of common law reasoning and the extent to which they frame and motivate judicial analysis these cases.

**Mackay J.**

[1] This is an application brought by Drummond Wren, owner of certain lands registered in the Registry Office for the County of York, to have declared invalid a restrictive covenant assumed by him when he purchased these lands and which he agreed to exact from his assigns, namely, — “Land not to be sold to Jews or persons of objectionable nationality.”

[2] The application is made by way of special leave and pursuant to s. 60 of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 152, and Rules 603 and 604 of The Rules of Practice and Procedure.

[3] Under s. 60(1) of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, a wide discretion is given to a judge to modify or discharge any condition or covenant “Where there is annexed to any land any condition or covenant that such land or any specified portion thereof is not to be built on or is to be or not to be used in a particular manner, or any other condition or covenant running with or capable of being legally annexed to land.”

[4] Rules 603 and 604 provide respectively that:

> 603. (1) Where any person claims to be the owner of land, but does not desire to have his title thereto quieted under *The Quieting Titles Act*, he may have any particular question which would arise upon an application to have his title quieted determined upon an originating notice.

> (2) Notice shall be given to all persons to whom notice would be given under *The Quieting Titles Act*, and the Court shall have the same power finally to dispose of and determine such particular question as it would have under the said Act, but this shall not render it necessary to give the notice required by Rule 705.

> 604. Where the rights of any person depend upon the construction of any deed, will or other instrument, he may apply by originating notice, upon notice to all persons concerned, to have his rights declared and determined.

[5] While, pursuant to an order made by me, notice of this application was served upon various persons interested in this and in adjacent lands subject to the same or a similar restrictive covenant, no one appeared in Court upon the return of this motion to oppose it.

[6] The restrictive covenant which is the subject of this proceeding and which by the deed aforesaid the grantee assumes and agrees to exact from his assigns, reads as follows: “Land not to be sold to Jews, or to persons of objectionable nationality.” Counsel for the applicant seeks the discharge and removal of this covenant on these alternative grounds: first, that it is void as against public policy; secondly, that it is invalid as a restraint on alienation; thirdly, that it is void for uncertainty; and fourthly, that it contravenes the provisions of The Racial Discrimination Act, 1944 (Ont.), c. 51. The matter before me, so defined, appears to raise issues of first impression, because a search of the case law of Great Britain and of Canada does not reveal any reported decision which would be of direct assistance in this proceeding.

[7] Counsel for the applicant did refer me to three Ontario cases dealing with restrictive covenants similar to that here involved, but, in my view, he rightly took the position that in none of those cases was the Court called upon to pass on the validity of the particular restriction in the way in which I am obliged to do in this case. Garrow J. in *Essex Real Estate Co. Ltd. v. Holmes*, 37 O.W.N. 392, affirmed 38 O.W.N. 69, did not have to determine the validity of the restriction in that case because he found that the purchaser of the land was not within its terms. Again, in *Re Bryers & Morris*, 40 O.W.N. 572, which was a vendor’s and purchaser’s motion, Hodgins J.A. refrained from passing on the validity of the restrictive covenant there in question. The third case mentioned by counsel for the applicant is a recent decision of Chevrier J., *Re McDougall and Waddell*, [1945] O.W.N. 272, [1945] 2 D.L.R. 244, which arose out of a vendor’s and purchaser’s motion for an order that the particular restrictive covenant there objected to offended against the terms of The Racial Discrimination Act, *supra*. The issue raised in that case was a narrow one, and I shall return to a discussion of it later in my judgment.

[8] In this short canvass of the authorities directly applicable, it may not be amiss to point out that, according to an affidavit filed on behalf of the applicant, the present Master of Titles at Toronto has not knowingly permitted anyone to register deeds containing restrictive covenants of a character similar to that in question here, and has on several occasions refused to accept for registration documents containing such covenants, and in no case has an appeal been taken from such refusal.

[9] The applicant’s argument is founded on the legal principle, briefly stated in 7 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1932, pp. 153-4, that: “Any agreement which tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good is void as being contrary to public policy.” Public policy, in the words of Halsbury, “varies from time to time.”

[10] In “The Growth of Law”, Mr. Justice Cardozo says: “Existing rules and principles can give us our present location, our bearings, our latitude and longitude. The inn that shelters for the night is not the journey’s end. The law, like the traveller, must be ready for the morrow. It must have a principle of growth.”

[11] And Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in “The Common Law”, says: “The very considerations which judges most rarely mention and always with an apology are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, what is expedient for the community concerned.”

[12] The matter of not creating new heads of public policy has been discussed at some length by McCardie J. in Naylor, *Benzon and Co., Limited v. Krainische Industrie Gesellschaft*, [1918] 1 K.B. 331, later affirmed by the Court of Appeal, [1918] 2 K.B. 486. There he points out that “the Courts have not hesitated in the past to apply the doctrine [of public policy] whenever the facts demanded its application.” “The truth of the matter,” he says, “seems to be that public policy is a variable thing. It must fluctuate with the circumstances of the time. This view is exemplified by the decisions which were discussed by the House of Lords in *Nordenfelt v. The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, Limited*, [1894] A.C. 535 . . . The principles of public policy remain the same, though the application of them may be applied in novel ways. The ground does not vary. As it was put by Tindal C.J. in *Horner v. Graves* (1831), 7 Bing. 735, 743, 131 E.R. 284. ‘Whatever is injurious to the interests of the public is void, on the grounds of public policy.’”

[13]  It is a well-recognized rule that courts may look at various Dominion and Provincial Acts and public law as an aid in determining principles relative to public policy: see *Walkerville Brewing Co. Ltd. v. Mayrand*, 63 O.L.R. 573, [1929] 2 D.L.R. 945.

[14] First and of profound significance is the recent San Francisco Charter, to which Canada was a signatory, and which the Dominion Parliament has now ratified. The preamble to this Charter reads in part as follows:

> We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small . . . and for these ends to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors . . .

[15] Under articles 1 and 55 of this Charter, Canada is pledged to promote “universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.”

[16] In the Atlantic Charter, to which Canada has subscribed, the principles of freedom from fear and freedom of worship are recognized.

[17] Section 1 of The Racial Discrimination Act, *supra*, provides:

> No person shall,

> (a) publish or display or cause to be published or displayed; or
> (b) permit to be published or displayed on lands or premises or in a newspaper, through a radio broadcasting station or by means of any other medium which he owns or controls, any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation indicating discrimination or an intention to discriminate against any person or any class of persons for any purpose because of the race or creed of such person or class of persons.

[18] The Provincial Legislature further has expressed itself in The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 256, s. 99, as follows: “Any licensed insurer which discriminates unfairly between risks within Ontario because of the race or religion of the insured shall be guilty of an offence.”

[19] Moreover, under s. 6 of the Regulations passed pursuant to The Community Halls Act, now R.S.O. 1937, c. 284, it is provided that “Every hall erected under this Act shall be available for any public gathering of an educational, fraternal, religious or social nature or for the discussion of any public question, and no organization shall be denied the use of the hall for religious, fraternal or political reasons.”

[20] Proceeding from the general to the particular, the argument of the applicant is that the impugned covenant is void because it is injurious to the public good. This deduction is grounded on the fact that the covenant against sale to Jews or to persons of objectionable nationality prevents the particular piece of land from ever being acquired by the persons against whom the covenant is aimed, and that this prohibition is without regard to whether the land is put to residential, commercial, industrial or other use. How far this is obnoxious to public policy can only be ascertained by projecting the coverage of the covenant with respect both to the classes of persons whom it may adversely affect, and to the lots or subdivisions of land to which it may be attached. So considered, the consequences of judicial approbation of such a covenant are portentous. If sale of a piece of land can be prohibited to Jews, it can equally be prohibited to Protestants, Catholics or other groups or denominations. If the sale of one piece of land can be so prohibited, the sale of other pieces of land can likewise be prohibited. In my opinion, nothing could be more calculated to create or deepen divisions between existing religious and ethnic groups in this province, or in this country, than the sanction of a method of land transfer which would permit the segregation and confinement of particular groups to particular business or residential areas, or, conversely, would exclude particular groups from particular business or residential areas. The unlikelihood of such a policy as a legislative measure is evident from the contrary intention of the recently-enacted Racial Discrimination Act, and the judicial branch of government must take full cognizance of such factors.

[21] Ontario, and Canada too, may well be termed a province, and a country, of minorities in regard to the religious and ethnic groups which live therein. It appears to me to be a moral duty, at least, to lend aid to all forces of cohesion, and similarly to repel all fissiparous tendencies which would imperil national unity. The common law courts have, by their actions over the years, obviated the need for rigid constitutional guarantees in our policy by their wise use of the doctrine of public policy as an active agent in the promotion of the public weal. While courts and eminent judges have, in view of the powers of our legislatures, warned against inventing new heads of public policy, I do not conceive that I would be breaking new ground were I to hold the restrictive covenant impugned in this proceeding to be void as against public policy. Rather would I be applying well-recognized principles of public policy to a set of facts requiring their invocation in the interest of the public good.

[22] That the restrictive covenant in this case is directed in the first place against Jews lends poignancy to the matter when one considers that anti-semitism has been a weapon in the hands of our recently-defeated enemies, and the scourge of the world. But this feature of the case does not require innovation in legal principle to strike down the covenant; it merely makes it more appropriate to apply existing principles. If the common law of treason encompasses the stirring up of hatred between different classes of His Majesty’s subjects, the common law of public policy is surely adequate to void the restrictive covenant which is here attacked.

[23] My conclusion therefore is that the covenant is void because offensive to the public policy of this jurisdiction. This conclusion is reinforced, if reinforcement is necessary, by the wide official acceptance of international policies and declarations frowning on the type of discrimination which the covenant would seem to perpetuate.

[24] It may not be inexpedient or improper to refer to a few declarations made by outstanding leaders under circumstances that arrest the attention and demand consideration of mankind. I first quote the late President Roosevelt:

> Citizens, regardless of religious allegiance, will share in the sorrow of our Jewish fellow-citizens over the savagery of the Nazis against their helpless victims. The Nazis will not succeed in exterminating their victims any more than they will succeed in enslaving mankind. The American people not only sympathize with all victims of Nazi crimes but will hold the perpetrators of these crimes to strict accountability in a day of reckoning which will surely come.

> I express the confident hope that the Atlantic Charter and the just World Order to be made possible by the triumph of the United Nations will bring the Jews and oppressed people in all lands the four freedoms which Christian and Jewish teachings have largely inspired.

[25] And of the Right Honourable Winston Churchill:

> In the day of victory the Jew’s sufferings and his part in the struggle will not be forgotten. Once again, at the appointed time, he will see vindicated those principles of righteousness which it was the glory of his fathers to proclaim to the world. Once again it will be shown that, though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small.

[26] And of General Charles de Gaulle:

> Be assured that since we have repudiated everything that has falsely been done in the name of France after June 23rd, the cruel decrees directed against French Jews can and will have no validity in Free France. These measures are not less a blow against the honour of France then they are an injustice against her Jewish citizens.

> When we shall have achieved victory, not only will the wrongs done in France itself be righted, but France will once again resume her traditional place as a protagonist of freedom and justice for all men, irrespective of race or religion, in a new Europe.

[27] Also, the resolution passed by the representatives of over sixty million organized workers at the World Trade Union Congress recently held at London that “every form of political, economic or social discrimination based on race, creed or sex, shall be eliminated.”

[28] The resolution against discrimination adopted unanimously by the Latin American nations and the United States in Mexico City on 6th March 1945, at the time of the Act of Chapultepec, is that the governments of these nations shall “prevent with all the means in their power all that may provoke discrimination among individuals because of racial and religious reasons.”

[29] It is provided in art. 123 of The Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, that:

> Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law.

> Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for, citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law.

[30] The second point raised by counsel for the applicant is that the covenant is invalid as a restraint on alienation. It is unnecessary to quote authorities in support of the long-established principle of the common law that land should be freely alienable. True, a limited class of exceptions to this general principle has from time to time been recognized, as in  *In re Macleay* (1875), L.R. 20 Eq. 186, though it may be pointed out that this decision runs counter to the earlier case of *Attwater v. Attwater* (1853), 18 Beav. 330, 52 E.R. 131. Moreover, in *In re Rosher*; *Rosher v. Rosher* (1884), 26 Ch. D. 801, Pearson J. stated that he failed to appreciate how the exception recognized in *In re Macleay* arose. It is not necessary to challenge the doctrine of *In re Macleay*, which has been followed in some Canadian cases, in order to find that the covenant with which I am concerned is invalid as a restraint on alienation. The particular covenant in the case before me is not limited either in time or to the life of the immediate grantee (see Sweet, Restraints on Alienation, 33 L.Q.R. 236, 342, particularly at p. 354), which would seem to be characteristic of the partial restraints which were enforced in the decided cases that I have been able to find. The principle of freedom of alienation has been too long and two well established in the jurisprudence of English and Canadian courts to warrant me at this late stage in recognizing a limitation upon it of a character not hitherto the subject of any reported case, especially in view of my conclusions as to public policy.

[31] Counsel for the applicant contended before me that the restrictive covenant here in question is void for uncertainty. So far as the words “persons of objectionable nationality” are concerned, the contention admits of no contradiction. The conveyancer who used these words surely must have realized, if he had given the matter any thought, that no court could conceivably find legal meaning in such vagueness. So far as the first branch of the covenant is concerned, that prohibiting the sale of the land to “Jews”, I am bound by the recent decision of the House of Lords in *Clayton et al. v. Ramsden et al.*, [1943] A.C. 320, [1943] 1 All E.R. 16, to hold that the covenant is in this respect also void for uncertainty; and I may add, that I would so hold even if the matter were *res integra*. The law lords in *Clayton v. Ramsden* were unanimous in holding that the phrase “of Jewish parentage” was uncertain, and Lord Romer was of the same opinion with regard to the phrase “of the Jewish faith”. I do not see that the bare term “Jews” admits of any more certainty.

[32] I should like, in conclusion, to refer to the judgment of Chevrier J. in *Re McDougall and Waddell*, *supra*. The learned judge there decided that the registration of a deed containing a covenant restricting the sale or user of land to “Gentiles (non-semetic [*sic*]) of European or British or Irish or Scottish racial origin” did not constitute an infringement of The Racial Discrimination Act. He came to this conclusion by holding that registration of a deed was not among the proscribed means of publishing or displaying enumerated in s. 1 of the Act. Counsel for the applicant herein contended that these proscribed means related only to the terms of clause (*b*) of s. 1, and that they did not qualify clause (*a*) of s. 1, which reads as follows:

> No person shall, — (*a*) publish or display or cause to be published or displayed . . . any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, or other representation indicating discrimination or an intention to discriminate against any person or any class of persons for any purpose because of the race or creed of such person or class of persons.

[33] Mr. Cartwright further submitted that if this section had been read by the learned judge without this limitation, registration in the Registry Office constituted publication of a notice or other representation as aforesaid, and that following 29 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1938, p. 444, “registration constitutes actual notice to all the world”, therefore he should have found that the particular clause was in breach of the said Act.

[34] I do not deem it necessary for the purpose of this case to deal with this argument, except to say that it appears to me to have considerable merit. My opinion as to the public policy applicable to this case in no way depends on the terms of The Racial Discrimination Act, save to the extent that such Act constitutes a legislative recognition of the policy which I have applied; in fact my brother Chevrier, as I read his judgment in *Re McDougall and Waddell*, is in accord with me in this respect.

[35] An order will therefore go declaring that the restrictive covenant attacked by the applicant is void and of no effect.

*Order accordingly*.

**The judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by Kerwin J.**:

[*This case—decided just five years after Re Drummond Wren—addressed a discriminatory restrictive covenant attached to land forming part of a summer resort development called the Beach O'Pines. The covenant, in clause (f), prohibited the sale, transfer or lease of the land to, or use or occupancy by, individuals of Jewish "race or blood" or people of colour, and expressed an intention to restrict ownership of land in the resort development to "persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause."*

*The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the restrictive covenant and explicitly rejected the application of the public policy doctrine relied on by Justice Mackay in Re Drummond Wren. On what grounds go Justices Kerwin and Taschereau at the Supreme Court overturn the Court of Appeal's decision? Is Re Drummond Wren applied? Rejected? What do you think is the reason from the Supreme Court's approach in this case?*]

[…]

[1] In the Courts below emphasis was laid upon the decision of Mackay J. in *Re Drummond Wren*, and it was considered that the motion was confined to the consideration of whether that case, if rightly decided, covered the situation. The motion was for an order declaring that the objection to the covenant made on behalf of the purchaser had been fully answered by the vendor and that the same did not constitute a valid objection to the title or for such further and other order as might seem just. The objection was:

> REQUIRED in view of the fact that the purchaser herein might be considered as being of the Jewish race or blood, we require a release from the restrictions imposed in the said clause (*f*) and an order declaring that the restrictive covenant set out in the said clause (*f*) is void and of no effect.

[2] The answer by the vendor was that the decision in *Re Drummond Wren* applied to the facts of the present sale with the result that clause (f) was invalid and the vendor and purchaser were not bound to observe it. In view of the wide terms of the notice of motion, the application is not restricted and it may be determined by a point taken before the Court of Appeal and this Court, if not before Mr. Justice Schroeder.

[3] That point depends upon the meaning of the rule laid down in *Tulk v. Moxhay*. This was a decision of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, affirming a decision of the Master of the Rolls. The judgment of the Master of the Rolls appears in 18 L.J.N.S. (Equity) 83, and the judgment of the Lord Chancellor is more fully reported there than in Phillips’ Reports. In the latter, the Lord Chancellor is reported as saying, page 777:

> That this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a contract between the owner of land and his neighbour purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is what I never knew disputed.

[4] In the Law Journal, the following appears at p. 87:

> I have no doubt whatever upon the subject; in short, I cannot have a doubt upon it, without impeaching what I have considered as the settled rule of this Court ever since I have known it. That this Court has authority to enforce a contract, which the owner of one piece of land may have entered into with his neighbour, founded, of course, upon good consideration, and valuable consideration, that he will either use or abstain from using his land in any manner that the other party by the contract stipulates shall be followed by the party who enters into the covenant, appears to me the very foundation of the whole of this jurisdiction. It has never, that I know of, been disputed.

[5] At p. 88 of the Law Journal, the Lord Chancellor states that the jurisdiction of the Court was not fettered by the question whether the convent ran with the land or not but that the question was whether a party taking property, the vendor having stipulated in a manner, binding by the law and principles of the Court of Chancery to use it in a particular way will not be permitted to use it in a way diametrically opposite to that which the party has covenanted for. To the same effect is p. 778 of Phillips’s.

[6] In view of these statements I am unable to gain any elucidation of the extent of the equitable doctrine from decisions at law such as *Congleton v. Pattison* and *Rogers v. Hosegood*. It is true that in the Court of Appeal, at p. 403, Collins L.J., after referring to extracts from the judgment of Sir George Jessel in *London & South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm*, said at p. 405:

> These observations, which are just as applicable to the benefit reserved as to the burden imposed, shew that in equity, just as at law, the first point to be determined is whether the covenant or contract in its inception binds the land. If it does, it is then capable of passing with the land to subsequent assignees; if it does not, it is incapable of passing by mere assignment of the land.

[7] This, however, leaves untouched the problem as to when a covenant binds the land.

[8] Whatever the precise delimitation in the rule in *Tulk v. Moxhay* may be, counsel were unable to refer us to any case where it was applied to a covenant restricting the alienation of land to persons other than those of a certain race. Mr. Denison did refer to three decisions in Ontario: *Essex Real Estate v. Holmes*; *Re Bryers and Morris*; *Re McDougall v. Waddell*; but he was quite correct in stating that they were of no assistance. The holding in the first was merely that the purchaser of the land there in question did not fall within a certain prohibition. In the second an inquiry was directed, without more. In the third, all that was decided was that the provisions of s. 1 of *The Racial Discrimination Act*, 1944, (Ontario), c. 51 would not be violated by a deed containing a covenant on the part of the purchaser that certain lands or any buildings erected thereon should not at any time be sold to, let to or occupied by any person or persons other than Gentiles (non-semitic (sic)) of European or British or Irish or Scottish racial origin.

[9] It was a forward step that the rigour of the common law should be softened by the doctrine expounded in *Tulk v. Moxhay* but it would be an unwarrantable extension of that doctrine to hold, from anything that was said in that case or in subsequent cases that the covenant here in question has any reference to the use, or abstention from use, of land. Even if decisions upon the common law could be prayed in aid, there are none that go to the extent claimed in the present case.

[10] The appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs of the original motions in the Supreme Court of Ontario.

**The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by Rand J.**:

[11] Covenants enforceable under the rule of *Tulk v. Moxhay*, are properly conceived as running with the land in equity and, by reason of their enforceability, as constituting an equitable servitude or burden on the servient land. The essence of such an incident is that it should touch or concern the land as contradistinguished from a collateral effect. In that sense, it is a relation between parcels, annexed to them and, subject to the equitable rule of notice, passing with them both as to benefit and burden in transmissions by operation of law as well as by act of the parties.

[12] But by its language, the covenant here is directed not to the land or to some mode of its use, but to transfer by act of the purchaser; its scope does not purport to extend to a transmission by law to a person within the banned class. If, for instance, the grantee married a member of that class, it is not suggested that the ordinary inheritance by a child of the union would be affected. Not only, then, it is not a covenant touching or concerning the land, but by its own terms it fails in annexation to the land. The respondent owners are, therefore, without any right against the proposed vendor.

[13] On its true interpretation, the covenant is a restraint on alienation. […]

[14] The effect of the covenant, if enforceable, would be to annex a partial inalienability as an equitable incident of the ownership, to nullify an area of proprietary powers. In both cases there is the removal of part of the power to alienate; and I can see no ground of distinction between the certainty required in the one case and that of the other. The uncertainty is, then, fatal to the validity of the covenant before us as a defect of or objection to the title.

[15] I would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment to the effect that the covenant is not an objection to the title of the proposed vendor, with costs to the appellants in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.

*Appeal allowed with costs*.



## Sources of Public Policy ##

One of the more remarkable aspects of the decision in *Re Drummond Wren* is its reliance on different sources of domestic and international law to ground the Court's finding that the restrictive covenant in issue was contrary to public policy. As you analyze the *3000 Funston Street* problem for this week, consider what role the following sources might play. 

Article 11 of the United Nations General Assembly's *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights* (1966) recognizes:

> [T]he right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate … housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.

In 2019, Canada enacted the *National Housing Strategy Act*, SC 2019, c 29 as a significant step toward implementing the federal government's commitment to the progressive realization of the right to housing. The preamble to the *Act* reads:

> Whereas housing is essential to the inherent dignity and well-being of the person and to building sustainable and inclusive communities as well as a strong national economy in which the people of Canada can prosper and thrive;
> 
> Whereas access to affordable housing contributes to achieving beneficial social, economic, health and environmental outcomes;
>
> Whereas improved housing outcomes are best achieved through cooperation between governments and civil society as well as the meaningful involvement of local communities;
>
> Whereas national goals, timelines and initiatives relating to housing and homelessness are essential to improving the quality of life of the people of Canada, particularly persons in greatest need;
>
> […]
>
> Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows: […]

In what way, if at all, might these sources play a role in analyzing the validity of the *3000 Funston Street* covenant?
