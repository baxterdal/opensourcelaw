This week we begin the last unit of the course, Unit 4. 

Our final unit offers an opportunity to revisit not only some of the substantive legal concepts we've studied throughout the course, but also to ask the question: *How can we make sense of our current moment in common law thought? Is there a "contemporary" legal style, and if so what are its features?*

As Justin Desautels-Stein has observed, the contemporary style of common law thought is not so much a third alternative to the *classical* and *modern* styles we studied in Units 2 and 3, as it is a "pragmatic" response by jurists to the shortcomings of these two styles that preceded it.[^stein2018] Unfortunately, the result is not a very satisfying one in terms of coherence or predictability. Whatever their shortcomings, both the classical and modern styles offered internally consistent (if ultimately incomplete) approaches to address the fundamental dilemma of liberalism with which we started our exploration of common law thought. By contrast, the pragmatism embraced in the contemporary style points to a willingness by jurists to draw on, mix and match features of the classical and modern styles—sometimes in the course of a single decision. The result, as Desautels-Stein suggests, is often a kind of "whatever works" response to the question of what makes the outcome in any given case a persuasive one. 

To be clear, such a result does not mean that judicial decisions in the contemporary style are devoid of legal reasoning or logic. It does, however, suggest that courts in the current moment have largely abandon any concerted attempt to resolve the basic liberal dilemma from a consistent perspective.

## Problems of Possession ##

In class this week, we will focus on two short problems:

### Problem 1: First Possession

Two children are playing on a beach and see an old abandoned boat washed up on shore. They both run for it. The faster one nearly reaches the vessel but trips on a piece of driftwood and sprains their ankle. The second child then overtakes the first, jumps on board and declares the boat "mine!". Who owns the boat?

### Problem 2: Airspace Rights

You client recently purchased a winter cottage, on a modest tract of land at the side of a mountain, adjacent to a popular ski resort in a small town. The resort owns land above and below the cottage and has recently unveiled plans to run one portion of a new ski lift directly over your client's land. Permanent cables for the lift would run less than 20 feet above the chalet. Is there a legal basis on which your client could challenge development of the proposed ski lift? Does it matter that the resort cannot continue to operate without expanding its access to the mountain and that over half of the town's residents are employed there?

*Popov v Hayashi*, below, received considerable media and popular attention when the events giving rise to the case unfolded in October 2001. In part, this was because the facts seemed so unusual, even extraordinary. The basic legal problem at the heart of the case, however, was nothing new. To get a sense of that problem and the actual circumstances surrounding the legal issue, watch the following recorded video of the events on October 7 at PacBell Park in San Francisco.

The starting point for characterizing the central legal issue in *Popov* is to recognize that, at the moment when the record-setting baseball made contact with Barry Bonds' bat we can assume—as the parties in the case agreed to do—that it was effectively abandoned property. This placed the baseball into the legal category of "unowned things"—not too dissimilar from the seals discussed in *Clift v Kane*. Being abandoned, the baseball was—as it sailed in the air toward the stands full of eager fans—unburdened from any prior proprietary entitlements and therefore free to be claimed by the first possessor.

Next, read Justice McCarthy's decision in *Popov v Hayashi* below. Pay close attention to both the result in the case and the judge's justifications for reaching that result. Does Justice McCarthy's decision typify the classical style, the modern style, some combination of these, or something else altogether?

McCarthy J :—

**Facts**

[1] In 1927, Babe Ruth hit sixty home runs. That record stood for thirty four years until Roger Maris broke it in 1961 with sixty one home runs. Mark McGwire hit seventy in 1998. On October 7, 2001, at PacBell Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit number seventy three. That accomplishment set a record which, in all probability, will remain unbroken for years into the future.

[2] The event was widely anticipated and received a great deal of attention.

[3] The ball that found itself at the receiving end of Mr. Bond’s bat garnered some of that attention. Baseball fans in general, and especially people at the game, understood the importance of the ball. It was worth a great deal of money and whoever caught it would bask, for a brief period of time, in the reflected fame of Mr. Bonds.

[4] With that in mind, many people who attended the game came prepared for the possibility that a record setting ball would be hit in their direction. Among this group were plaintiff Alex Popov and defendant Patrick Hayashi. They were unacquainted at the time. Both men brought baseball gloves, which they anticipated using if the ball came within their reach.

[5] They, along with a number of others, positioned themselves in the arcade section of the ballpark. This is a standing room only area located near right field. It is in this general area that Barry Bonds hits the greatest number of home runs.2 The area was crowded with people on October 7, 2001 and access was restricted to those who held tickets for that section.

[6] Barry Bonds came to bat in the first inning. With nobody on base and a full count, Bonds swung at a slow knuckleball. He connected. The ball sailed over the right-field fence and into the arcade.

[7] Josh Keppel, a cameraman who was positioned in the arcade, captured the event on videotape. Keppel filmed much of what occurred from the time Bonds hit the ball until the commotion in the arcade had subsided. He was standing very near the spot where the ball landed and he recorded a significant amount of information critical to the disposition of this case.

[8] In addition to the Keppel tape, seventeen percipient witnesses testified as to what they saw after the ball came into the stands. The testimony of these witnesses varied on many important points. Some of the witnesses had a good vantage point and some did not. Some appeared disinterested in the outcome of the litigation and others had a clear bias. Some remembered the events well and others did not. Some were encumbered by prior inconsistent statements which diminished their credibility.

[9] The factual findings in this case are the result of an analysis of the testimony of all the witnesses as well as a detailed review of the Keppel tape. Those findings are as follows:

[10] When the seventy-third home run ball went into the arcade, it landed in the upper portion of the webbing of a softball glove worn by Alex Popov. While the glove stopped the trajectory of the ball, it is not at all clear that the ball was secure. Popov had to reach for the ball and in doing so, may have lost his balance.

[11] Even as the ball was going into his glove, a crowd of people began to engulf Mr. Popov. He was tackled and thrown to the ground while still in the process of attempting to complete the catch. Some people intentionally descended on him for the purpose of taking the ball away, while others were involuntarily forced to the ground by the momentum of the crowd.

[12] Eventually, Mr. Popov was buried face down on the ground under several layers of people. At one point he had trouble breathing. Mr. Popov was grabbed, hit and kicked. People reached underneath him in the area of his glove. Neither the tape nor the testimony is sufficient to establish which individual members of the crowd were responsible for the assaults on Mr. Popov.

[13] The videotape clearly establishes that this was an out of control mob, engaged in violent, illegal behavior. Although some witnesses testified in a manner inconsistent with this finding, their testimony is specifically rejected as being false on a material point.

[14] Mr. Popov intended at all times to establish and maintain possession of the ball. At some point the ball left his glove and ended up on the ground. It is impossible to establish the exact point in time that this occurred or what caused it to occur.

[15] Mr. Hayashi was standing near Mr. Popov when the ball came into the stands. He, like Mr. Popov, was involuntarily forced to the ground. He committed no wrongful act. While on the ground he saw the loose ball. He picked it up, rose to his feet and put it in his pocket.

[16] Although the crowd was still on top of Mr. Popov, security guards had begun the process of physically pulling people off. Some people resisted those efforts. One person argued with an official and another had to be pulled off by his hair.

[17] Mr. Hayashi kept the ball hidden. He asked Mr. Keppel to point the camera at him. At first, Mr. Keppel did not comply and Mr. Hayashi continued to hide the ball. Finally after someone else in the crowd asked Mr. Keppel to point the camera at Mr. Hayashi, Mr. Keppel complied. It was only at that point that Mr. Hayashi held the ball in the air for others to see. Someone made a motion for the ball and Mr. Hayashi put it back in his glove. It is clear that Mr. Hayashi was concerned that someone would take the ball away from him and that he was unwilling to show it until he was on videotape. Although he testified to the contrary, that portion of his testimony is unconvincing.

[18] Mr. Popov eventually got up from the ground. He made several statements while he was on the ground and shortly after he got up which are consistent with his claim that he had achieved some level of control over the ball and that he intended to keep it. Those statements can be heard on the audio portion of the tape. When he saw that Mr. Hayashi had the ball he expressed relief and grabbed for it. Mr. Hayashi pulled the ball away. Security guards then took Mr. Hayashi to a secure area of the stadium.

[19] It is important to point out what the evidence did not and could not show. Neither the camera nor the percipient witnesses were able to establish whether Mr. Popov retained control of the ball as he descended into the crowd. Mr. Popov’s testimony on this question is inconsistent on several important points, ambiguous on others and, on the whole, unconvincing. We do not know when or how Mr. Popov lost the ball.

[20] Perhaps the most critical factual finding of all is one that cannot be made. We will never know if Mr. Popov would have been able to retain control of the ball had the crowd not interfered with his efforts to do so. Resolution of that question is the work of a psychic, not a judge.

**Legal Analysis**

[21] Plaintiff has pled causes of actions for conversion, trespass to chattel, injunctive relief and constructive trust.

[22] Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of another. There must be actual interference with the plaintiff’s dominion. Wrongful withholding of property can constitute actual interference even where the defendant lawfully acquired the property. If a person entitled to possession of personal property demands its return, the unjustified refusal to give the property back is conversion.

[23] The act constituting conversion must be intentionally done. There is no requirement, however, that the defendant know that the property belongs to another or that the defendant intends to dispossess the true owner of its use and enjoyment. Wrongful purpose is not a component of conversion.

[24] The injured party may elect to seek either specific recovery of the property or monetary damages.

[25] Trespass to chattel, in contrast, exists where personal property has been damaged or where the defendant has interfered with the plaintiff’s use of the property. Actual dispossession is not an element of the tort of trespass to chattel.

[26] In the case at bar, Mr. Popov is not claiming that Mr. Hayashi damaged the ball or that he interfered with Mr. Popov’s use and enjoyment of the ball. He claims instead that Mr. Hayashi intentionally took it from him and refused to give it back. There is no trespass to chattel. If there was a wrong at all, it is conversion.

[27] Conversion does not exist, however, unless the baseball rightfully belongs to Mr. Popov. One who has neither title nor possession, nor any right to possession, cannot sue for conversion. The deciding question in this case then, is whether Mr. Popov achieved possession or the right to possession as he attempted to catch and hold on to the ball.

[28] The parties have agreed to a starting point for the legal analysis. Prior to the time the ball was hit, it was possessed and owned by Major League Baseball. At the time it was hit it became intentionally abandoned property. The first person who came in possession of the ball became its new owner.

[29] The parties fundamentally disagree about the definition of possession. In order to assist the court in resolving this disagreement, four distinguished law professors participated in a forum to discuss the legal definition of possession. The professors also disagreed.

[30] The disagreement is understandable. Although the term possession appears repeatedly throughout the law, its definition varies depending on the context in which it is used. Various courts have condemned the term as vague and meaningless.

[31] This level of criticism is probably unwarranted.

[32] While there is a degree of ambiguity built into the term possession, that ambiguity exists for a purpose. Courts are often called upon to resolve conflicting claims of possession in the context of commercial disputes. A stable economic environment requires rules of conduct which are understandable and consistent with the fundamental customs and practices of the industry they regulate. Without that, rules will be difficult to enforce and economic instability will result. Because each industry has different customs and practices, a single definition of possession cannot be applied to different industries without creating havoc.

[33] This does not mean that there are no central principles governing the law of possession. It is possible to identify certain fundamental concepts that are common to every definition of possession.

[34] Professor Roger Bernhardt has recognized that “[p]ossession requires both physical control over the item and an intent to control it or exclude others from it. But these generalizations function more as guidelines than as direct determinants of possession issues. Possession is a blurred question of law and fact.”

[35] Professor Brown argues that “[t]he orthodox view of possession regards it as a union of the two elements of the physical relation of the possessor to the thing, and of intent. This physical relation is the actual power over the thing in question, the ability to hold and make use of it. But a mere physical relation of the possessor to the thing in question is not enough. There must also be manifested an intent to control it.”

[36] The task of this court is to use these principles as a starting point to craft a definition of possession that applies to the unique circumstances of this case.

[37] We start with the observation that possession is a process which culminates in an event. The event is the moment in time that possession is achieved. The process includes the acts and thoughts of the would be possessor which lead up to the moment of possession.

[38] The focus of the analysis in this case is not on the thoughts or intent of the actor. Mr. Popov has clearly evidenced an intent to possess the baseball and has communicated that intent to the world. The question is whether he did enough to reduce the reduce the ball to his exclusive dominion and control. Were his acts sufficient to create a legally cognizable interest in the ball?

[39] Mr. Hayashi argues that possession does not occur until the fan has complete control of the ball. Professor Brian Gray, suggests the following definition “A person who catches a baseball that enters the stands is its owner. A ball is caught if the person has achieved complete control of the ball at the point in time that the momentum of the ball and the momentum of the fan while attempting to catch the ball ceases. A baseball, which is dislodged by incidental contact with an inanimate object or another person, before momentum has ceased, is not possessed. Incidental contact with another person is contact that is not intended by the other person. The first person to pick up a loose ball and secure it becomes its possessor.”

[40] Mr. Popov argues that this definition requires that a person seeking to establish possession must show unequivocal dominion and control, a standard rejected by several leading cases. Instead, he offers the perspectives of Professor Bernhardt and Professor Paul Finkelman who suggest that possession occurs when an individual intends to take control of a ball and manifests that intent by stopping the forward momentum of the ball whether or not complete control is achieved.

[41] Professors Finkelman and Bernhardt have correctly pointed out that some cases recognize possession even before absolute dominion and control is achieved. Those cases require the actor to be actively and ably engaged in efforts to establish complete control. Moreover, such efforts must be significant and they must be reasonably calculated to result in unequivocal dominion and control at some point in the near future.

[42] This rule is applied in cases involving the hunting or fishing of wild animals or the salvage of sunken vessels. The hunting and fishing cases recognize that a mortally wounded animal may run for a distance before falling. The hunter acquires possession upon the act of wounding the animal not the eventual capture. Similarly, whalers acquire possession by landing a harpoon, not by subduing the animal.

[43] In the salvage cases, an individual may take possession of a wreck by exerting as much control “as its nature and situation permit”. Inadequate efforts, however, will not support a claim of possession. Thus, a “sailor cannot assert a claim merely by boarding a vessel and publishing a notice, unless such acts are coupled with a then present intention of conducting salvage operations, and he immediately thereafter proceeds with activity in the form of constructive steps to aid the distressed party.”

[44] These rules are contextual in nature. The are crafted in response to the unique nature of the conduct they seek to regulate. Moreover, they are influenced by the custom and practice of each industry. The reason that absolute dominion and control is not required to establish possession in the cases cited by Mr. Popov is that such a rule would be unworkable and unreasonable. The “nature and situation” of the property at issue does not immediately lend itself to unequivocal dominion and control. It is impossible to wrap ones arms around a whale, a fleeing fox or a sunken ship.

[45] The opposite is true of a baseball hit into the stands of a stadium. Not only is it physically possible for a person to acquire unequivocal dominion and control of an abandoned baseball, but fans generally expect a claimant to have accomplished as much. The custom and practice of the stands creates a reasonable expectation that a person will achieve full control of a ball before claiming possession. There is no reason for the legal rule to be inconsistent with that expectation. Therefore Gray’s Rule is adopted as the definition of possession in this case.

[46] The central tenant of Gray’s Rule is that the actor must retain control of the ball after incidental contact with people and things. Mr. Popov has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have retained control of the ball after all momentum ceased and after any incidental contact with people or objects. Consequently, he did not achieve full possession.

### Mini-Lecture: Rule of Possession

{{< vimeo 684772872 >}}

{{% /callout %}}{{< /spoiler >}}

[47] That finding, however, does not resolve the case. The reason we do not know whether Mr. Popov would have retained control of the ball is not because of incidental contact. It is because he was attacked. His efforts to establish possession were interrupted by the collective assault of a band of wrongdoers.

[48] A decision which ignored that fact would endorse the actions of the crowd by not repudiating them. Judicial rulings, particularly in cases that receive media attention, affect the way people conduct themselves. This case demands vindication of an important principle. We are a nation governed by law, not by brute force.

[49] As a matter of fundamental fairness, Mr. Popov should have had the opportunity to try to complete his catch unimpeded by unlawful activity. To hold otherwise would be to allow the result in this case to be dictated by violence. That will not happen.

[50] For these reasons, the analysis cannot stop with the valid observation that Mr. Popov has not proved full possession.

[51] The legal question presented at this point is whether an action for conversion can proceed where the plaintiff has failed to establish possession or title. It can. An action for conversion may be brought where the plaintiff has title, possession or the right to possession.

[52] Here Mr. Popov seeks, in effect, a declaratory judgment that he has either possession or the right to possession. In addition he seeks the remedies of injunctive relief and a constructive trust. These are all actions in equity. A court sitting in equity has the authority to fashion rules and remedies designed to achieve fundamental fairness.

[53] Consistent with this principle, the court adopts the following rule. Where an actor undertakes significant but incomplete steps to achieve possession of a piece of abandoned personal property and the effort is interrupted by the unlawful acts of others, the actor has a legally cognizable pre-possessory interest in the property. That pre-possessory interest constitutes a qualified right to possession which can support a cause of action for conversion.

[54] Possession can be likened to a journey down a path. Mr. Popov began his journey unimpeded. He was fast approaching a fork in the road. A turn in one direction would lead to possession of the ball ––– he would complete the catch. A turn in the other direction would result in a failure to achieve possession ––– he would drop the ball. Our problem is that before Mr. Popov got to the point where the road forked, he was set upon by a gang of bandits, who dislodged the ball from his grasp.

[55] Recognition of a legally protected pre-possessory interest, vests Mr. Popov with a qualified right to possession and enables him to advance a legitimate claim to the baseball based on a conversion theory. Moreover it addresses the harm done by the unlawful actions of the crowd.

[56] It does not, however, address the interests of Mr. Hayashi. The court is required to balance the interests of all parties.

[57] Mr. Hayashi was not a wrongdoer. He was a victim of the same bandits that attacked Mr. Popov. The difference is that he was able to extract himself from their assault and move to the side of the road. It was there that he discovered the loose ball. When he picked up and put it in his pocket he attained unequivocal dominion and control.

[58] If Mr. Popov had achieved complete possession before Mr. Hayashi got the ball, those actions would not have divested Mr. Popov of any rights, nor would they have created any rights to which Mr. Hayashi could lay claim. Mr. Popov, however, was able to establish only a qualified pre-possessory interest in the ball. That interest does not establish a full right to possession that is protected from a subsequent legitimate claim.

[59] On the other hand, while Mr. Hayashi appears on the surface to have done everything necessary to claim full possession of the ball, the ball itself is encumbered by the qualified pre-possessory interest of Mr. Popov. At the time Mr. Hayashi came into possession of the ball, it had, in effect, a cloud on its title.

[60] An award of the ball to Mr. Popov would be unfair to Mr. Hayashi. It would be premised on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have caught the ball. That assumption is not supported by the facts. An award of the ball to Mr. Hayashi would unfairly penalize Mr. Popov. It would be based on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have dropped the ball. That conclusion is also unsupported by the facts.

[61] Both men have a superior claim to the ball as against all the world. Each man has a claim of equal dignity as to the other. We are, therefore, left with something of a dilemma.

[62] Thankfully, there is a middle ground.

[63] The concept of equitable division was fully explored in a law review article authored by Professor R.H. Helmholz in the December 1983 edition of the Fordham Law Review. Professor Helmholz addressed the problems associated with rules governing finders of lost and mislaid property. For a variety of reasons not directly relevant to the issues raised in this case, Helmholz suggested employing the equitable remedy of division to resolve competing claims between finders of lost or mislaid property and the owners of land on which the property was found.

[64] There is no reason, however, that the same remedy cannot be applied in a case such as this, where issues of property, tort and equity intersect.

[65] The concept of equitable division has its roots in ancient Roman law. As Helmholz points out, it is useful in that it “provides an equitable way to resolve competing claims which are equally strong.” Moreover, “[i]t comports with what one instinctively feels to be fair”.

[66] Although there is no California case directly on point, *Arnold v. Producers Fruit Company* (1900) 128 Cal. 637, 61 P. 283 provides some insight. There, a number of different prune growers contracted with Producer’s Fruit Company to dry and market their product. Producers did a bad job. They mixed fruit from many different growers together in a single bin and much of the fruit rotted because it was improperly treated.

[67] When one of the plaintiffs offered proof that the fruit in general was rotten, Producers objected on the theory that the plaintiff could not prove that the prunes he contributed to the mix were the same prunes that rotted. The court concluded that it did not matter. After the mixing was done, each grower had an undivided interest in the whole, in proportion to the amount of fruit each had originally contributed.

[68] The principle at work here is that where more than one party has a valid claim to a single piece of property, the court will recognize an undivided interest in the property in proportion to the strength of the claim.

[69] Application of the principle of equitable division is illustrated in the case of *Keron v. Cashman* (1896) 33 A. 1055. In that case, five boys were walking home along a railroad track in the city of Elizabeth New Jersey. The youngest of the boys came upon an old sock that was tied shut and contained something heavy. He picked it up and swung it. The oldest boy took it away from him and beat the others with it. The sock passes from boy to boy. Each controlled it for a short time. At some point in the course of play, the sock broke open and out spilled $775 as well as some rags, cloths and ribbons.

[70] The court noted that possession requires both physical control and the intent to reduce the property to one’s possession. Control and intent must be concurrent. None of the boys intended to take possession until it became apparent that the sock contained money. Each boy had physical control of the sock at some point before that discovery was made.

[71] Because none could present a superior claim of concurrent control and intent, the court held that each boy was entitled to an equal share of the money. Their legal claims to the property were of equal quality, therefore their entitlement to the property was also equal.

[72] Here, the issue is not intent, or concurrence. Both men intended to possess the ball at the time they were in physical contact with it. The issue, instead, is the legal quality of the claim. With respect to that, neither can present a superior argument as against the other.

[73] Mr. Hayashi’s claim is compromised by Mr. Popov’s pre-possessory interest. Mr. Popov cannot demonstrate full control. Albeit for different reasons, they stand before the court in exactly the same legal position as did the five boys. Their legal claims are of equal quality and they are equally entitled to the ball.

[74] The court therefore declares that both plaintiff and defendant have an equal and undivided interest in the ball. Plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion is sustained only as to his equal and undivided interest. In order to effectuate this ruling, the ball must be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties.

[75] The parties are ordered to meet and confer forthwith before Judge Richard Kramer to come to an agreement as to how to implement this decision. If no decision is made by December 30, 2002, the parties are directed to appear before this court on that date at 9:00 am.

[76] The court retains jurisdiction to issue orders consistent with this decision. The ball is to remain in the custody of the court until further order.

## Airspace Rights ##

As we have seen, possession plays a key role in establishing property in both things (i.e. chattels) and in the surface of land. The surface owner or possessor of land will, of course, often want to do things that extend well into the airspace above the surface. But the sky is a long way up. How high do rights of possession extend—and more importantly, how are such rights established? Are they a natural extension of surface rights, or is there more a surface owner needs to do in order to establish their rights to such airspace?

**Haddad JA :—**

[1] The single issue in this appeal is to determine, on the particular facts which follow, whether the respondent has trespassed the air space above the appellants’ land.

[2] The material facts are not in dispute. The respondent, an electrical utility company, constructed a power line on the municipal road allowance along the east side of the appellants’ land. The distance between the centre of the base of four power poles, each approximately 50 feet in height, to the boundary of the appellants’ land is two feet. The cross-arms conductors and attaching wires at the top of each pole (collectively called “the cross-arms”) protrude six feet into the air space above the appellants’ land.

[3] The appellants in these proceedings, commenced by originating notice of motion, seek a declaration that the cross-arms amount to a trespass. The following paragraph from the affidavit of the appellant, Kenneth W. Didow, sets forth the appellants’ concerns:

> There is an old farm yard with a residence on the land. The power line overhangs the east side of the farm yard and we consider it to be unsightly. Since Alberta Power Limited cut down the existing trees under the overhang, we would be reluctant to plant trees in any other area of the overhang. We are also concerned about the danger associated with the lines and the location and operation of tall machinery and equipment such as steel augers or metal granaries under the overhang. In addition, the overhang will restrict the use of aerial spraying and seeding on the land.

[4] The learned chambers judge considered a series of authorities and concluded that the protrusion did not interfere with the appellants’ possession of the air space or its right to possession [45 Alta. L.R. (2d) 116, 37 C.C.L.T. 90, 36 L.C.R. 139, 70 A.R. 199]. He applied the following test [pp. 123-24]:

> Clearly the question is, is it an interference with possession or even the right to possession?
>
> Here the applicants do not claim any diminution in their right to full enjoyment of their property. Indeed, the facts are that they are not making use of the air space occupied by the cross-arms and wires and they have no intention of doing so.

[5] With respect, that statement does not take into account the problems, actual or potential, referred to in Kenneth W. Didow’s affidavit. Moreover, I have read the relevant authorities and applying the principles and tests I extract therefrom I arrive at a conclusion contrary to that reached by the learned chambers judge. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.

[6] The character of a trespass was not put in controversy. In essence, it is an unjustifiable interference with possession. The appellants are the registered owners of the land below the air space and their status to bring this action is not in dispute.

[7] A resolution of the issue before the court turns on the extent of the rights acquired by the appellants to the column of air above and within the boundaries of the land.

[8] The jurisprudence in this area of the law has developed from early English cases, before the advent of air traffic, where decisions were influenced by the maxim *cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos* (referred to hereafter as “the Latin maxim”) which in simple language means that the owner of a piece of land owns everything above and below it to an indefinite extent.

[9] The authorities cited can, generally speaking, be divided into two groups:

1. Cases involving permanent structural projections into the air space above another’s land;

2. Cases involving a transient invasion into the air space above another’s land at a height not likely to interfere with the land owner.

[10] With respect to cases in the first group, the weight of authority favours the view that a direct invasion by a permanent artificial projection constitutes a trespass.

[11] The appellants, as have all claimants to air space, rely in the main on the Latin maxim. This maxim has been the subject of constant attack in air space litigation over the years and if not discredited has been qualified in its application. Some of the older cases cited by the respondent were aimed at establishing that an overhanging encroachment will have nuisance value only and is therefore not actionable in trespass. This theory is no longer viable, according to recent authority, at least insofar as it applies to structures of a permanent nature.

[12] The first of the early decisions cited is *Baten’s Case* (1610), 9 Co. Rep. 53b, 77 E.R. 810, where a portion of the defendant’s new home was found to overhang part of the plaintiff’s home. Notwithstanding reference to the foregoing maxim the court characterized the overhang as a nuisance. Today, by the application of modern concepts, the overhang, in my view, would be treated as a trespass.

[13] In *Pickering v. Rudd* (1815), 4 Camp. 219, 171 E.R. 70, and *Fay v. Prentice* (1845), 1 C.B. 828, 135 E.R. 769, it was said that the appropriate remedy in each case was an action in nuisance. Each dealt with projections over an adjoining property.

[14] In *Pickering*, the alleged overhang consisted of a board and Lord Ellenborough did not “think it a trespass to interfere with the air superincumbent on the close”. Caution led him to reject trespass by reasoning that to hold otherwise “an aeronaut is liable to an action in trespass *quare clausum fregit*, at the suit of the occupier of every field over which his balloon passes in the course of his voyage.” Subsequent judicial pronouncements and existing laws regulating aircraft have now removed Lord Ellenborough’s concern. His decision has been supplanted by more recent authority. (See *Kelsen v. Imp. Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain & Ireland)*, [1957] 2 Q.B. 334, [1957] 2 W.L.R. 1007, [1957] 2 All E.R. 343.)

[15] The encroachment of overhanging tree branches litigated in *Lemmon v. Webb*, [1894] 3 Ch. 1, 10 T.L.R. 467, was also actionable only in nuisance — on sound reasoning. Lindley L.J. found no analogy between an artificial projection and the consequential interference caused by the branch of a tree which could be severed.

[16] *Corbett v. Hill* (1870), L.R. 9 Eq. 671, sustained an action in trespass and acknowledged an owner’s right to air space — at least to the vertical column of air over a building.

[17] The decision in *Wandsworth Bd. of Works v. United Telephone Co.* (1884), 13 Q.B.D. 904 (C.A.), although rejecting a plea of trespass on the facts, confirmed a land owner’s rights to air space without explicitly defining the extent of those rights. Telephone wires strung above a street was held not to be a trespass because, by statute, the surface was vested in the board, not as absolute owner, but for the purpose only of maintaining a street. Accordingly, it acquired no right to the air above the street. Their Lordships distinguished between that kind of ownership and that of owners of land vested by ordinary conveyance. The tenor of the three judgments delivered is that absolute ownership of the surface in the board would have created rights to the air space to justify a finding of trespass by the placement of overhead wires. This case has received recognition for the characterization given by Brett M.R. to the Latin maxim as a “fanciful phrase” to diminish its application in a literal sense.

[18] I come now to cases decided after the turn of the century. In *Gifford v. Dent*, [1926] W.N. 336, and *Kelsen v. Imp. Tobacco Co.*, supra, the court in each case leaned on the Latin maxim in concluding that an overhanging sign amounted to a trespass of air space.

[19] McNair J. in the *Kelsen* case refused to follow the decision in *Pickering v. Rudd*. In holding that a trespass had been committed as opposed to a nuisance he adopted the reasoning of cases which followed later in time. He referred, with approval, to both *Wandsworth Bd. of Works* and *Gifford v. Dent*. In rejecting *Pickering*, he thought it significant that in the Civil Aviation Act “the legislature found it necessary expressly to negative the action of trespass or nuisance” arising from an airplane overhead. He interpreted that to mean that the legislature did not share Lord Ellenborough’s view in *Pickering*. He said “Accordingly, I reach the conclusion that a trespass, and not a mere nuisance, was created by the invasion of the plaintiff’s air space by this sign.”

[20] The facts recited by McNair J. disclosed that the presence of the sign in his air space caused the plaintiff no harm or inconvenience and did not diminish his enjoyment. Moreover, His Lordship put no value in the argument that the plaintiff did not require the use of the air space. I particularly mention these facts because the test employed by the learned chambers judge, based on similar circumstances, according to the excerpt from his judgment quoted at the outset of these reasons, led to a verdict adverse to the appellants.

[21] The learned chambers judge distinguished *Kelsen* on the ground that the litigants were tenants within the same building. With respect, that only clouds the issue. As McNair J. discussed and disposed of the defendant’s reliance on the terms of its lease, the ratio of the case did not turn on the tenancies nor was this aspect argued by counsel before this court.

[22] Counsel for the appellants argues, with some justification, that *Kelsen* and the case at bar are indistinguishable.

[23] Plowman J. presided over the case of *Ward v. Gold*, 211 E.G. 155, [1969] E.G.D. 630, where the offending intrusion consisted of overhanging eaves. There is nothing distinctive about this case except to say that in the opinion of Plowman J. the *Kelsen* case was in point and he upheld the action taken in trespass.

[24] The authorities to which I have referred following *Fay v. Prentice*, supra, establish that the right to use land includes the right to use and enjoy the air space above the land. These cases cautiously fall short of saying that ownership of land includes ownership of all air space above the land. In any event, they serve to make clear that intrusion by an artificial or permanent structure into the air space of another is forbidden as a trespass.

[25] Cases which fall into the second group involve transient invasion of air space at a height unlikely to affect the landowner. The cases in this group to which the respondent is attracted deal with airplanes. Predicated on sound logic and common sense both case law and statute law now decree that a landowner cannot object to air traffic which does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of his property.

[26] The respondent’s strongest submission is that actionable trespass only occurs when the intrusion into air space actually interferes with a landowner’s use and enjoyment of that space. Its submissions follow the statements leading to the decision reached by the chambers judge. The argument is directed to convince the court that a landowner cannot object to an intrusion into air space over his land which he is not actually occupying and using for the time being. Counsel points to public policy principles developed by the courts to permit the use of aircraft in air space and then argues that analogous public policy considerations apply to air space intrusion by overhead electrical installations. As an extension of that argument he says that tens of thousands of miles of transmission lines across Alberta occupy private property.

[27] The analogy is hardly appropriate. Aircraft which are transient and invade space at a height beyond the contemplation of reasonable and ordinary use by the landowner cannot be equated with a low level intrusion of a permanent nature. I agree with the opinion stated of Griffiths J. in *Lord Bernstein of Leigh v. Skyviews & Gen. Ltd.*, [1978] A.C. 479, [1977] 3 W.L.R. 136, [1977] 2 All E.R. 902, that low flying aircraft might very well commit a trespass.

[28] Moreover, if there are many miles of transmission lines already trespassing the air space above private property without any leave or licence, they will not transform an unlawful practice into a lawful one.

[29] The respondent cited *Lacroix v. R.*, [1954] Ex. C.R. 69, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 470, to advance the proposition that the landowner’s rights to the air space over his property were limited to what he could possess or occupy. This case arose out of a claim for compensation for an easement to provide lighting for the purposes of aerial navigation of aircraft using the Dorval Airport as well as a claim for damages. It was alleged that the air space over the claimant’s land was used by aircraft as a flightway to and from the airport. Fournier J. referred to the Latin maxim as a maxim not suited to meet the development and invention of today’s world. In its application, its interpretation in his view, has to be restricted without depriving the landowner of full enjoyment of his property — a principle which he endorsed. That portion of his judgment which lends support to the respondent’s position is to be found at pp. 76-77 where he said:

> It seems to me that the owner of land has a limited right in the air space over his property; it is limited by what he can possess or occupy for the use and enjoyment of his land. By putting up buildings or other constructions the owner does not take possession of the air but unites or incorporates something to the surface of his land. This which is annexed or incorporated to his land becomes part and parcel of the property ...

> I need go only so far as to say that the owner of land is not and cannot be the owner of the unlimited air space over his land, because air and space fall in the cateogry of *res omnium communis*. For these reasons the suppliant’s claim for damages by reason of the so-called establishment of a flightway over his land fails.

[30] The second case which gives the respondent comfort is *Air Can. v. R.*, [1978] 2 W.W.R. 694, 86 D.L.R. (3d) 631, *(*sub nom. *Min. of Fin. (Man.) v. Air Can.)* [1978] C.T.C. 812 (C.A.), cited to expound the proposition that ownership of air space cannot be claimed by anyone as it falls under the category of omnium communis. This case is distinguishable on the facts as the claim to jurisdiction to air space is made by the province of Manitoba. It unsuccessfully asserted its right to levy a sales tax against Air Canada in respect of goods and services provided by it while occupying air space over the province. Moreover, the case is not founded in trespass. However, the comments of Monnin J.A (now C.J.M.) are relevant and of some significance. After accepting a statement made by the trial judge, which is of no account here, he said at p. 697:

> … I would rather rest the case on the basis that air and airspace are not the subject of ownership by anyone, either state or individual, but fall in the category of res omnium communis.

[31] Later in his reasons, Mr. Justice Monnin (at p. 699) quoted an extract from the judgment delivered in *Lord Bernstein of Leigh v. Skyviews & Gen. Ltd.*, supra, at p. 907 — in which Griffiths J. qualified the application of the Latin maxim by suggesting “a balance” in compromising the rights of landowners against the general public. Monnin J.A. then added these remarks:

> The maxim cannot go further than to direct the owner or occupier of land in his enjoyment of the land and also to prevent anyone else from acquiring any title or exclusive right to the space above such land so as to limit a person to whatever proper use he can make of his land.

[32] After giving due consideration to the judgment in *Bernstein* I find the reasoning of Griffiths J. most persuasive. He reviewed the earlier decisions which found favour with the Latin maxim and the circumstance in each instance in which it was applied. At p. 905 of his reasons, he said:

> The plaintiff claims that as owner of the land he is also owner of the air space above the land, or at least has the right to exclude any entry into the air space above his land. He relies on the old Latin maxim, cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos, a colourful phrase often on the lips of lawyers since it was first coined by Accursius in Bologna in the 13th century. There are a number of cases in which the maxim has been used by English judges but an examination of those cases shows that they have all been concerned with structures attached to the adjoining land, such as overhanging buildings, signs or telegraph wires, and for their solution it has not been necessary for the judge to cast his eyes towards the heavens; he has been concerned with the rights of the owner in the air space immediately adjacent to the surface of the land.

> That an owner has certain rights in the air space above his land is well established by authority.

[33] Following a reference to *Gifford v. Dent* Mr. Justice Griffiths discussed the judgment of McNair J. in *Kelsen*. He quoted the words used by McNair J. in reaching his final conclusion and then made this assessment relevant to that decision at p. 906:

> I very much doubt if in that passage McNair J was intending to hold that the plaintiff’s rights in the air space continued to an unlimited height or “ad coelum” as counsel for the plaintiff submits. The point that the judge was considering was whether the sign was a trespass or a nuisance at the very low level at which it projected. This to my mind is clearly indicated by his reference to Winfield on Tort in which the text reads: “... it is submitted that trespass will be committed by [aircraft] to the air-space if they fly so low as to come within the area of ordinary user.” The author in that passage is careful to limit the trespass to the height at which it is contemplated an owner might be expected to make use of the air space as a natural incident of the user of his land. If, however, the learned judge was by his reference to the Civil Aviation Act 1949, and his disapproval of the views of Lord Ellenborough in *Pickering v. Rudd*, indicating the opinion that the flight of an aircraft at whatever height constituted a trespass at common law, I must respectfully disagree.

> I do not wish to cast any doubts on the correctness of the decision on its own particular facts. It may be a sound and practical rule to regard any incursion into the air space at a height which may interfere with the ordinary user of the land as a trespass rather than a nuisance. Adjoining owners then know where they stand; they have no right to erect structures overhanging or passing over their neighbours’ land and there is no room for argument whether they are thereby causing damage or annoyance to their neighbours about which there may be much room for argument and uncertainty. But wholly different considerations arise when considering the passage of aircraft at a height which in no way affects the user of the land.

[34] Griffiths J. makes a valid distinction between permanent structures which interfere with air space and transient invasions by aircraft to demonstrate that differing considerations apply. At the same time, his remarks convey approval of the decision reached by McNair J. in *Kelsen*. In my view the approach he pursues is both reasonable and practical. Lord Wilberforce took the opportunity to trace the Latin maxim’s origin and to attack its literal application in *Commr. for Ry. v. Valuer-General*, [1974] A.C. 328, [1973] 2 W.L.R. 1021, [1973] 3 All E.R. 268, [1972-73] A.L.R. 1209, [1973] 1 N.S.W.L.R. 1 (sub nom. *Commr. for Ry. (N.S.W.) v. Wynyard Hldg. Ltd.*) (Aus.). The maxim found its way into a dispute regarding the valuation of land for rating purposes. At pp. 351-52 (A.C.) Lord Wilberforce described the maxim as:

> so sweeping, unscientific and unpractical a doctrine is unlikely to appeal to the common law mind. At most the maxim is used as a statement, imprecise enough, of the extent of the rights, prima facie, of owners of land ...

[35] The criticism levelled at the Latin maxim by Lord Wilberforce and others no doubt influenced the reasoning of Griffiths J. in *Bernstein v. Skyviews*. Recognizing that the maxim must be given limited application, Griffiths J. conceived the idea of striking a “balance”.

[36] The quotation from the *Bernstein* case at p. 907, which appears in the reasons delivered by Monnin J.A. in *Air Can.* provides a reasonable test in determining the rights of a landlord to the air space above his land. He said:

> The problem is to balance the rights of an owner to enjoy the use of his land against the rights of the general public to take advantage of all that science now offers in the use of air space. This balance is in my judgment best struck in our present society by restricting the rights of an owner in the air space above his land to such height as is necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of his land and the structures on it, and declaring that above that height he has no greater rights in the air space than any other member of the public.

[37] Fournier J. in *Lacroix* limited the landowner’s rights to what he could possess and occupy. Griffiths J. in *Skyviews* took a broader view by recognizing the landowner’s right to enjoy the use of air space above his land without limitation except as to height. Beyond the height necessary for the landowner’s use, the air space becomes public domain.

[38] The Supreme Court of the United States has also considered the landowner’s rights in air space in *U.S. v. Causby*, 328 U.S. 256, 90 L. Ed. 1206, 66 S. Ct. 1062 (1946). While rejecting the Latin maxim as having no place in the modern world — it preserved the landowner’s rights to this extent at pp. 264-65 which, in my view, is consistent with the views of Griffiths J. in *Bernstein v. Skyviews*:

> The landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land ... The fact that he does not occupy it in any physical sense — by the erection of buildings and the like — is not material ... While the owner does not in physical manner occupy that stratum of airspace or make use of it in the conventional sense, he does use it in somewhat the same sense that space left between buildings for the purpose of light and air is used. The superadjacent airspace at this low altitude is so close to the land that continuous invasions of it affect the use of the surface of the land itself. We think that the landowner, as an incident to his ownership, has a claim to it and that invasions of it are in the same category as invasions of the surface.

[39] The two concepts which become apparent are firstly that the courts will not give literal effect to the Latin maxim and secondly, the proper remedy for interference with a landowner’s air space with a permanent fixture is in trespass as opposed to nuisance.

[40] In my opinion, the balancing criterion formulated by Griffiths J. is a logical compromise to the rights of the landowner and the general public. It is a test I adopt. I view this test as saying a landowner is entitled to freedom from permanent structures which in any way impinge upon the actual or potential use and enjoyment of his land. The cross-arms constitute a low level intrusion which interferes with the appellant’s potential, if not actual, use and enjoyment. This amounts to trespass.

[41] For the sole purpose of comment I refer to the cases of *Woollerton & Wilson Ltd. v. Richard Costain Ltd.*, [1970] 1 W.L.R. 411, [1970] 1 All E.R. 483, and *Lewvest Ltd. v. Scotia Towers Ltd.* (1981), 19 R.P.R. 192, 10 C.E.L.R. 139, 126 D.L.R. 239 (Nfld. T.D.), where, in each instance, it was held that an overhanging crane used in the construction of a building trespassed a landowner’s air space, notwithstanding that the cranes were not permanent intrusions. In light of the distinction now recognized in encroachment cases between nuisance and trespass my inclination would be to characterize the overhanging cranes as a nuisance.

[42] I would allow the appeal and grant the appellants the declaratory relief sought by them. The appellant are entitled to costs throughout.

*Appeal allowed.*
