This week, which begins Unit 3, we move away from the classical period of legal reasoning we studied last term and into the second style of liberal legal thought we'll confront in the course: the *modern style*. To do so, we will return to a topic we analyzed in Week 9—the field of expropriation and the extent to which property owners can exclude the state from taking away or otherwise interfering with "their" property rights. 

With the move to online for the start of Winter term, we'll pivot to a problem-based learning model for each week of the course. My hope is that this will reduce the amount of time you need to spend in online lectures (where we know ability to absorb and process new information is limited) and allow each of you more flexibility in allocating your "in-class" time for studying the course materials in a way that works best for you. 

In practical terms, this modified approach means that I will start each week's readings by presenting a fact pattern-based problem that explores the relevant legal issue(s) for the week. We will then use this problem to develop an understanding of the assigned cases and other materials. I have recorded a series of mini-lectures and included these throughout the readings to guide your study of the materials—think of these as a replacement for an online Zoom session, but one that is more usefully integrated with your reading. We will then meet virtually once per week to discuss and address answers to the problem, based on your preparation of the materials.

## Problem: Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes  ##

{{< figure src="/media/blue_mountain.jpg" caption="Irwin Barrett - Ecology Action Centre" >}}

The Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area is a provincially-protected wilderness area within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Blue Mountain-Birch Cove was designated in 2009 from 1,316 hectares of Crown land and later expanded, in 2015, to 1,767 hectares. Several private landowners own undeveloped lands adjacent to the current protected area. One of those landowners is the Annapolis Group Inc. (Annapolis), whose undeveloped lands remain essentially naturalized areas that include woodlands, watercourses, etc. 

{{< figure src="/media/blue_mountain_map.png" caption="Map of Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Protected Area, Wikimedia Commons" link="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Blue_Mountain_Birch_Cove_Lakes_map.png/2048px-Blue_Mountain_Birch_Cove_Lakes_map.png" >}}

In 2006, the HRM Council passed a Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) intended to guide future land development in the regional municipality for the next 25 years. In effect, the Regional MPS lays out a vision for future land development across the region based on broad public consultation but does not commit the municipality to undertake any specific actions pursuant to the plan. 

The 2006 Regional MPS designated a portion of Annapolis' lands for possible future serviced development (such as a low-density residential subdivision) and a portion for a possible future regional park. 

At the same time as the HRM Council passed the Regional MPS, it also passed the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law, which establishes and assigns the necessary land-use zones needed to implement the MPS designations. Under the zoning by-law, no development can occur on the Annapolis lands unless the HRM Council passes a resolution authorizing a secondary planning process and subsequent zoning amendment. In 2007, Annapolis requested that HRM Council initiate such a secondary planning process. But after widespread public backlash against Annapolis' development plans (which included a proposal to shrink the proposed park to accommodate a larger subdivision development), Council instead passed a resolution in 2016 refusing to proceed with further planning and zoning changes to the Annapolis lands. As a result, the current zoning by-law continues to prohibit any development on those lands.

In 2017, Annapolis filed a Notice of Action and Statement of Claim alleging that HRM had *de facto* expropriated its lands for public use as a park. As part of this claim, Annapolis alleges that HRM encouraged members of the public to hike, cycle, canoe, camp and swim on its lands (along with the protected lands within the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Wilderness Area) and financially supported organizations making similar encouragements.

Annapolis claims compensation for the *de facto* expropriation under Nova Scotia's *Expropriation Act*, which provides that every person whose land is expropriated by a public authority shall be paid reasonable compensation. The *Expropriation Act* defines "expropriation" as a "taking of land" but does not further define what amounts to such a taking. 

This case is currently before the Supreme Court of Canada. Based on the facts above, is the Court likely to find that HRM has *de facto* expropriated Annapolis' land, thereby ordering the municipality to pay compensation? We will try to come up with an initial answer to this question based on the materials studied this week.

### Review: The Classical Approach to Expropriation

Before you read and listen to the new material below, recall the case of *McLaren v Caldwell* from Week 9. In that case, the courts attempted to decide whether or not legislation passed in Ontario gave the public a right to float logs down non-navigable (and therefore "privately owned") streams. 

**Re-read paragraph 17 of [Justice Ritchie's judgement for the Supreme Court of Canada](../week9/#mclaren-v-caldwell-et-al-1882-8-scr-435).** What principle does Justice Ritchie articulate in this part of his judgement? How does he use this principle to ground his conclusion that Ontario could not have intended to expropriate McLaren's property without compensation? Could we use this principle to resolve the issue  of *de facto* expropriation in the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove case—and if so, how?

## Oliver Wendell Holmes, "The Path of Law" (1897) 10 *Harvard Law Review* 457 ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/holmes.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/holmes.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/holmes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

When we study law we are not studying a mystery but a well-known profession. We are studying what we shall want in order to appear before judges, or to advise people in such a way as to keep them out of court. The reason why it is a profession, why people will pay lawyers to argue for them or to advise them, is that in societies like ours the command of the public force is intrusted to the judges in certain cases, and the whole power of the state will be put forth, if necessary, to carry out their judgments and decrees. People want to know under what circumstances and how far they will run the risk of coming against what is so much stronger than themselves, and hence it becomes a business to find out when this danger is to be feared. The object of our study, then, is prediction, the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts.


The means of the study are a body of reports, of treatises, and of statutes, in this country and in England, extending back for six hundred years, and now increasing annually by hundreds. In these sibylline leaves are gathered the scattered prophecies of the past upon the cases in which the axe will fall. These are what properly have been called the oracles of the law. Far the most important and pretty nearly the whole meaning of every new effort of legal thought is to make these prophecies more precise, and to generalize them into a thoroughly connected system. The process is one, from a lawyer's statement of a case, eliminating as it does all the dramatic elements with which his client's story has clothed it, and retaining only the facts of legal import, up to the final analyses and abstract universals of theoretic jurisprudence. The reason why a lawyer does not mention that his client wore a white hat when he made a contract, while Mrs. Quickly would be sure to dwell upon it along with the parcel gilt goblet and the sea-coal fire, is that he foresees that the public force will act in the same way whatever his client had upon his head. It is to make the prophecies easier to be remembered and to be understood that the teachings of the decisions of the past are put into general propositions and gathered into textbooks, or that statutes are passed in a general form. The primary rights and duties with which jurisprudence busies itself again are nothing but prophecies. One of the many evil effects of the confusion between legal and moral ideas, about which I shall have something to say in a moment, is that theory is apt to get the cart before the horse, and consider the right or the duty as something existing apart from and independent of the consequences of its breach, to which certain sanctions are added afterward. But, as I shall try to show, a legal duty so called is nothing but a prediction that if a man does or omits certain things he will be made to suffer in this or that way by judgment of the court; and so of a legal right.

The number of our predictions when generalized and reduced to a system is not unmanageably large. They present themselves as a finite body of dogma which may be mastered within a reasonable time. It is a great mistake to be frightened by the ever-increasing number of reports. The reports of a given jurisdiction in the course of a generation take up pretty much the whole body of the law, and restate it from the present point of view. We could reconstruct the corpus from them if all that went before were burned. The use of the earlier reports is mainly historical, a use about which I shall have something to say before I have finished.

I wish, if I can, to lay down some first principles for the study of this body of dogma or systematized prediction which we call the law, for men who want to use it as the instrument of their business to enable them to prophesy in their turn, and, as bearing upon the study, I wish to point out an ideal which as yet our law has not attained.
The first thing for a businesslike understanding of the matter is to understand its limits, and therefore I think it desirable at once to point out and dispel a confusion between morality and law, which sometimes rises to the height of conscious theory, and more often and indeed constantly is making trouble in detail without reaching the point of consciousness. You can see very plainly that a bad man has as much reason as a good one for wishing to avoid an encounter with the public force, and therefore you can see the practical importance of the distinction between morality and law. A man who cares nothing for an ethical rule which is believed and practised by his neighbors is likely nevertheless to care a good deal to avoid being made to pay money, and will want to keep out of jail if he can.

I take it for granted that no hearer of mine will misinterpret what I have to say as the language of cynicism. The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law. For that purpose you must definitely master its specific marks, and it is for that that I ask you for the moment to imagine yourselves indifferent to other and greater things.

I do not say that there is not a wider point of view from which the distinction between law and morals becomes of secondary or no importance, as all mathematical distinctions vanish in presence of the infinite. But I do say that that distinction is of the first importance for the object which we are here to consider — a right study and mastery of the law as a business with well understood limits, a body of dogma enclosed within definite lines. I have just shown the practical reason for saying so. If you want to know the law and nothing else, you must look at it as a bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which such knowledge enables him to predict, not as a good one, who finds his reasons for conduct, whether inside the law or outside of it, in the vaguer sanctions of conscience. The theoretical importance of the distinction is no less, if you would reason on your subject aright. The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and by the mere force of language continually invites us to pass from one domain to the other without perceiving it, as we are sure to do unless we have the boundary constantly before our minds. The law talks about rights, and duties, and malice, and intent, and negligence, and so forth, and nothing is easier, or, I may say, more common in legal reasoning, than to take these words in their moral sense, at some state of the argument, and so to drop into fallacy. For instance, when we speak of the rights of man in a moral sense, we mean to mark the limits of interference with individual freedom which we think are prescribed by conscience, or by our ideal, however reached. Yet it is certain that many laws have been enforced in the past, and it is likely that some are enforced now, which are condemned by the most enlightened opinion of the time, or which at all events pass the limit of interference, as many consciences would draw it. Manifestly, therefore, nothing but confusion of thought can result from assuming that the rights of man in a moral sense are equally rights in the sense of the Constitution and the law. No doubt simple and extreme cases can be put of imaginable laws which the statute-making power would not dare to enact, even in the absence of written constitutional prohibitions, because the community would rise in rebellion and fight; and this gives some plausibility to the proposition that the law, if not a part of morality, is limited by it. But this limit of power is not coextensive with any system of morals. For the most part it falls far within the lines of any such system, and in some cases may extend beyond them, for reasons drawn from the habits of a particular people at a particular time. I once heard the late Professor Agassiz say that a German population would rise if you added two cents to the price of a glass of beer. A statute in such a case would be empty words, not because it was wrong, but because it could not be enforced. No one will deny that wrong statutes can be and are enforced, and we would not all agree as to which were the wrong ones.

The confusion with which I am dealing besets confessedly legal conceptions. Take the fundamental question, What constitutes the law? You will find some text writers telling you that it is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason, that it is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions. But if we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws for the axioms or deductions, but that he does want to know what the Massachusetts or English courts are likely to do in fact. I am much of this mind. The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.

Take again a notion which as popularly understood is the widest conception which the law contains — the notion of legal duty, to which already I have referred. We fill the word with all the content which we draw from morals. But what does it mean to a bad man? Mainly, and in the first place, a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment of money. But from his point of view, what is the difference between being fined and taxed a certain sum for doing a certain thing? That his point of view is the test of legal principles is proven by the many discussions which have arisen in the courts on the very question whether a given statutory liability is a penalty or a tax. On the answer to this question depends the decision whether conduct is legally wrong or right, and also whether a man is under compulsion or free. Leaving the criminal law on one side, what is the difference between the liability under the mill acts or statutes authorizing a taking by eminent domain and the liability for what we call a wrongful conversion of property where restoration is out of the question. In both cases the party taking another man's property has to pay its fair value as assessed by a jury, and no more. What significance is there in calling one taking right and another wrong from the point of view of the law? It does not matter, so far as the given consequence, the compulsory payment, is concerned, whether the act to which it is attached is described in terms of praise or in terms of blame, or whether the law purports to prohibit it or to allow it. If it matters at all, still speaking from the bad man's point of view, it must be because in one case and not in the other some further disadvantages, or at least some further consequences, are attached to the act by law. The only other disadvantages thus attached to it which I ever have been able to think of are to be found in two somewhat insignificant legal doctrines, both of which might be abolished without much disturbance. One is, that a contract to do a prohibited act is unlawful, and the other, that, if one of two or more joint wrongdoers has to pay all the damages, he cannot recover contribution from his fellows. And that I believe is all. You see how the vague circumference of the notion of duty shrinks and at the same time grows more precise when we wash it with cynical acid and expel everything except the object of our study, the operations of the law.

[…]

So much for the limits of the law. The next thing which I wish to consider is what are the forces which determine its content and its growth. You may assume, with Hobbes and Bentham and Austin, that all law emanates from the sovereign, even when the first human beings to enunciate it are the judges, or you may think that law is the voice of the Zeitgeist, or what you like. It is all one to my present purpose. Even if every decision required the sanction of an emperor with despotic power and a whimsical turn of mind, we should be interested none the less, still with a view to prediction, in discovering some order, some rational explanation, and some principle of growth for the rules which he laid down. In every system there are such explanations and principles to be found. It is with regard to them that a second fallacy comes in, which I think it important to expose.

The fallacy to which I refer is the notion that the only force at work in the development of the law is logic. In the broadest sense, indeed, that notion would be true. The postulate on which we think about the universe is that there is a fixed quantitative relation between every phenomenon and its antecedents and consequents. If there is such a thing as a phenomenon without these fixed quantitative relations, it is a miracle. It is outside the law of cause and effect, and as such transcends our power of thought, or at least is something to or from which we cannot reason. The condition of our thinking about the universe is that it is capable of being thought about rationally, or, in other words, that every part of it is effect and cause in the same sense in which those parts are with which we are most familiar. So in the broadest sense it is true that the law is a logical development, like everything else. The danger of which I speak is not the admission that the principles governing other phenomena also govern the law, but the notion that a given system, ours, for instance, can be worked out like mathematics from some general axioms of conduct. This is the natural error of the schools, but it is not confined to them. I once heard a very eminent judge say that he never let a decision go until he was absolutely sure that it was right. So judicial dissent often is blamed, as if it meant simply that one side or the other were not doing their sums right, and if they would take more trouble, agreement inevitably would come.

This mode of thinking is entirely natural. The training of lawyers is a training in logic. The processes of analogy, discrimination, and deduction are those in which they are most at home. The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of logic. And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man. Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You always can imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some opinion as to policy, or, in short, because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battle grounds where the means do not exist for the determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place. We do not realize how large a part of our law is open to reconsideration upon a slight change in the habit of the public mind. No concrete proposition is self evident, no matter how ready we may be to accept it, not even Mr. Herbert Spencer's "Every man has a right to do what he wills, provided he interferes not with a like right on the part of his neighbors."

[…]

I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage. The duty is inevitable, and the result of the often proclaimed judicial aversion to deal with such considerations is simply to leave the very ground and foundation of judgments inarticulate, and often unconscious, as I have said. When socialism first began to be talked about, the comfortable classes of the community were a good deal frightened. I suspect that this fear has influenced judicial action both here and in England, yet it is certain that it is not a conscious factor in the decisions to which I refer. I think that something similar has led people who no longer hope to control the legislatures to look to the courts as expounders of the constitutions, and that in some courts new principles have been discovered outside the bodies of those instruments, which may be generalized into acceptance of the economic doctrines which prevailed about fifty years ago, and a wholesale prohibition of what a tribunal of lawyers does not think about right. I cannot but believe that if the training of lawyers led them habitually to consider more definitely and explicitly the social advantage on which the rule they lay down must be justified, they sometimes would hesitate where now they are confident, and see that really they were taking sides upon debatable and often burning questions.

### Holmes' Modernism in Practice

In the quarter century after he wrote *The Path of Law*, Holmes became a leading member of the United States Supreme Court and in 1922 he penned the majority decision in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*. *Mahon* became a foundational case in American law on the issue of *de facto* expropriation ("constructive takings" in American legal parlance)—one that affirmed landowners' rights to compensation for such expropriations as protected under the United States Constitution. 

*Mahon* is a useful case for us because it is an early example in which both judges—Holmes for the majority, and Brandeis in dissent—demonstrate a willingness to embrace the modern style, despite the fact that they disagree on the outcome of the case. At the same time, we still see vestiges of the classical approach. As you read the two decisions in *Mahon*, try to identify the work being done by Holmes' functionalist method from *The Path of Law*, along with that being done by the other important features of the modern style described above. On what grounds do the judges in the case disagree about whether or not there has been a *de facto* expropriation of the coal company's property?

**Mr. Justice Holmes** delivered the opinion of the Court.

[1] This is a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house. The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface, but, in express terms, reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same, and the grantee takes the premises with the risk, and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that, whatever may have been the Coal Company's rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921, P.L. 1198, commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that, if not restrained, the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought, but denied an injunction, holding that the statute, if applied to this case, would be unconstitutional. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power, and directed a decree for the plaintiffs. A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.

[2] The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case, the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.

[3] Government hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation, and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits, or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases, there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature, but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.

[4] This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. *Rideout v. Knox*, 148 Mass. 368. But usually, in ordinary private affairs, the public interest does not warrant much of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public. *Wesson v. Washburn Iron Co.*, 13 Allen 95, 103. The extent of the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed, the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand, the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land -- a very valuable estate -- and what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the plaintiffs' position alone, we should think it clear that the statute does not disclose a public interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of the defendant's constitutionally protected rights.

[5] But the case has been treated as one in which the general validity of the act should be discussed. The Attorney General of the State, the City of Scranton, and the representatives of other extensive interests were allowed to take part in the argument below, and have submitted their contentions here. It seems, therefore, to be our duty to go farther in the statement of our opinion, in order that it may be known at once, and that further suits should not be brought in vain.

[6] It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, "For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it." *Commonwealth v. Clearview Coal Co.*, 256 Pa.St. 328, 331. What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. This we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.

[7] It is true that, in *Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania*, 232 U. S. 531, it was held competent for the legislature to require a pillar of coal to the left along the line of adjoining property, that with the pillar on the other side of the line would be a barrier sufficient for the safety of the employees of either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water. But that was a requirement for the safety of employees invited into the mine, and secured an average reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various laws.

[8] The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support, we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. *Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co.*, 208 U. S. 598, 208 U. S. 605. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more, until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.

[9] The general rule, at least, is that, while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go -- and, if they go beyond the general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. *Bowditch v. Boston*, 101 U. S. 16. In general, it is not plain that a man's misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor's shoulders. *Spade v. Lynn & Boston R.R. Co.*, 172 Mass. 488, 489. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said, this is a question of degree -- and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They were to the verge of the law, but fell far short of the present act. *Block v. Hirsh*, 256 U. S. 135; *Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman*, 256 U. S. 170; *Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel*, 258 U. S. 242.

[10] We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.

*Decree reversed.*

**Mr. Justice Brandeis** dissenting.

[11] The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in such a manner or to such an extent 

> "as to cause the . . .subsidence of . . . any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation, or any factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile establishment in which human labor is employed."

[12] Coal in place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation, and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character, and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?

[13] Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgement by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious -- as it may because of further change in local or social conditions -- the restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy his property as heretofore.

[14] The restriction upon the use of this property cannot, of course, be lawfully imposed unless its purpose is to protect the public. But the purpose of a restriction does not cease to be public because, incidentally, some private persons may thereby receive gratuitously valuable special benefits. Thus, owners of low buildings may obtain, through statutory restrictions upon the height of neighboring structures, benefits equivalent to an easement of light and air. *Welch v. Swasey*, 214 U. S. 91. Compare *Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.*, 220 U. S. 61; *Walls v. Midland Carbon Co.*, 254 U. S. 300. Furthermore, a restriction, though imposed for a public purpose, will not be lawful unless the restriction is an appropriate means to the public end. But to keep coal in place is surely an appropriate means of preventing subsidence of the surface; and ordinarily it is the only available means. Restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means merely because it deprives the owner of the only use to which the property can then be profitably put. The liquor and the oleomargine cases settled that. *Mugler v. Kansas*, 123 U. S. 623, 123 U. S. 668-669; *Powell v. Pennsylvania*, 127 U. S. 678, 127 U. S. 682. See also *Hadacheck v. Los Angeles*, 239 U. S. 394; *Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope*, 248 U. S. 498. Nor is a restriction imposed through exercise of the police power inappropriate as a means, merely because the same end might be effected through exercise of the power of eminent domain, or otherwise at public expense. Every restriction upon the height of buildings might be secured through acquiring by eminent domain the right of each owner to build above the limiting height; but it is settled that the state need not resort to that power. Compare *Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco*, 216 U. S. 358; *Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Omaha*, 235 U. S. 121. If, by mining anthracite coal, the owner would necessarily unloose poisonous gases, I suppose no one would doubt the power of the state to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may not the state, likewise without paying compensation, prohibit one from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the community to like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying on the business would be a public nuisance.

[15] It is said that one fact for consideration in determining whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the resulting diminution in value, and that here the restriction destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If we are to consider the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the land. That is, with the value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole. The estate of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as extending *ab orco usque ad coelum*. But I suppose no one would contend that, by selling his interest above 100 feet from the surface, he could prevent the state from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a city. And why should a sale of underground rights bar the state's power? For aught that appears, the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction may be negligible as compared with the value of the whole property, or even as compared with that part of it which is represented by the coal remaining in place and which may be extracted despite the statute. Ordinarily a police regulation, general in operation, will not be held void as to a particular property, although proof is offered that, owing to conditions peculiar to it, the restriction could not reasonably be applied. See *Powell v. Pennsylvania*; *Murphy v. California*.  But even if the particular facts are to govern, the statute should, in my opinion be upheld in this case. For the defendant has failed to adduce any evidence from which it appears that to restrict its mining operations was an unreasonable exercise of the police power. Compare *Reinman v. Little Rock*; *Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope*. Where the surface and the coal belong to the same person, self-interest would ordinarily prevent mining to such an extent as to cause a subsidence. It was, doubtless, for this reason that the legislature, estimating the degrees of danger, deemed statutory restriction unnecessary for the public safety under such conditions.

[16] It is said that this is a case of a single dwelling house, that the restriction upon mining abolishes a valuable estate hitherto secured by a contract with the plaintiffs, and that the restriction upon mining cannot be justified as a protection of personal safety, since that could be provided for by notice. The propriety of deferring a good deal to tribunals on the spot has been repeatedly recognized. *Welch v. Swasey*; *Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco*; *Patsone v. Pennsylvania*. May we say that notice would afford adequate protection of the public safety where the legislature and the highest court of the State, with greater knowledge of local conditions, have declared, in effect, that it would not? If the public safety is imperilled, surely neither grant nor contract can prevail against the exercise of the police power. *Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park*; *Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. North Carolina*; *Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation*; *St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis*. The rule that the state's power to take appropriate measures to guard the safety of all who may be within its jurisdiction may not be bargained away was applied to compel carriers to establish grade crossings at their own expense, despite contracts to the contrary; *Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v. Nebraska*;and, likewise, to supersede, by an Employers' Liability Act, the provision of a charter exempting a railroad from liability for death of employees, since the civil liability was deemed a matter of public concern, and not a mere private right. *Texas & New Orleans R.R. Co. v. Miller*. *Compare Boyd v. Alabama*; *Stone v. Mississippi*; *Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co.*; *Douglas v. Kentucky*; *Pennsylvania Hospital v. Philadelphia*. Nor can existing contracts between private individuals preclude exercise of the police power. "One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction cannot remove them from the power of the state by making a contract about them." *Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter*; *Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville*; *Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co.*. The fact that this suit is brought by a private person is, of course, immaterial. To protect the community through invoking the aid, as litigant, of interested private citizens is not a novelty in our law. That it may be done in Pennsylvania was decided by its Supreme Court in this case. And it is for a state to say how its public policy shall be enforced.

[17] This case involves only mining which causes subsidence of a dwelling house. But the Kohler Act contains provisions in addition to that quoted above; and as to these also, an opinion is expressed. These provisions deal with mining under cities to such an extent as to cause subsidence of

> "(a) Any public building or any structure customarily used by the public as a place of resort, assemblage, or amusement, including, but not limited to, churches, schools, hospitals, theaters, hotels, and railroad stations."

> "(b) Any street, road, bridge, or other public passageway, dedicated to public use or habitually used by the public."

> "(c) Any track, roadbed, right of way, pipe, conduit, wire, or other facility, used in the service of the public by any municipal corporation or public service company as defined by the Public Service Law."

[18] A prohibition of mining which causes subsidence of such structures and facilities is obviously enacted for a public purpose, and it seems likewise clear that mere notice of intention to mine would not in this connection secure the public safety. Yet it is said that these provisions of the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems to rest upon the assumption that, in order to justify such exercise of the police power, there must be "an average reciprocity of advantage" as between the owner of the property restricted and the rest of the community, and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage is an important consideration, and may even be an essential, where the state's power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the property of a neighborhood, as in drainage projects, *Wurts v. Hoagland*; *Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley*; or upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions, *Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., ante*. But where the police power is exercised not to confer benefits upon property owners but to protect the public from detriment and danger, there is, in my opinion, no room for considering reciprocity of advantage. There was no reciprocal advantage to the owner prohibited from using his oil tanks in 248 U. S. 248 U.S. 498; his brickyard, in 239 U. S. 239 U.S. 394; his livery stable, in 237 U. S. 237 U.S. 171; his billiard hall, in 225 U. S. 225 U.S. 623; his oleomargarine factory, in 127 U. S. 127 U.S. 678; his brewery, in 123 U. S. 123 U.S. 623; unless it be the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the act to the coal operators.

## *De Facto* Expropriation in Canadian Law ##

*The Path of Law* and *Mahon* are both American sources but they—like others we have seen in the course—exerted a significant influence over the thinking of Canadian jurists during the twentieth century. The American law loomed large in this area because of its especially strong protections for private property against uncompensated takings. Nevertheless, other than a small handful of cases prior to the 1990s, a specifically Canadian jurisprudence around *de facto* expropriation remained all but ignored by Canadian judges. It was not until the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal's decision in *Mariner Real Estate Ltd.* that anything like a recognizable legal test for *de facto* expropriation began to emerge.

As you read *Mariner*, below, focus on two important aspects of the case:

1. The degree to which Justice Cromwell's decision is structured by features of the modern style we have identified so far—in what ways does the decision conform or not to the modern style?

2. The specific legal test for *de facto* expropriation that emerges from the case—how would you articulate the elements of this test?

Once you have grappled with these questions, return to the [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove problem](#problem-blue-mountain-birch-cove-lakes) and consider how the issue in that case might be resolved, based on the law you've learned so far this week. We will take this up together in our online meeting.

**Cromwell JA** (Glube CJNS concurring):

**I. Introduction:**

[1] This case involves a collision of important interests. On one side, there are the interests of the respondents in the enjoyment of their privately owned land at Kingsburg Beach. On the other is the public interest in the protection and preservation of environmentally fragile and ecologically significant beach, dune and beach ridge resources. In the background of this case is the policy issue of how minutely government may control land without buying it. But in the foreground is the narrower issue of whether the stringent land use regulations applied by the Province to the respondents’ lands is an expropriation of them within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156.

[2] The respondents’ lands were designated as a beach under the *Beaches Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 32. This designation brings with it a host of restrictions on the uses of and activities on the land. Pursuant to power conferred by the *Act* and Regulations made under it, the Minister refused to grant the respondents permission to build single family dwellings on their land. The respondents sued, claiming their lands had, in effect, been expropriated and that they were entitled to compensation. Tidman, J., at trial, found that there had been an expropriation.

[3] In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge made two key findings. First, he decided that the respondents had been deprived of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. There were alternative bases for this finding. One basis was that the designation, on its own, was, in law, a taking of land. The alternative basis was that the taking resulted from the designation coupled with the application to the respondents’ lands of the regulatory regime flowing from the designation. These, in combination, in the judge’s view, took away virtually all of the land’s economic value and virtually extinguished all rights of ownership.

[4] The second key holding by the trial judge was that the province acquired land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act* because the regulation of the respondents’ lands enhanced the value of the provincially owned property from the high watermark seaward.

[5] In my respectful view, the learned trial judge erred in each of these conclusions. For reasons which I will develop, my view is that the loss of economic value resulting from land use regulation is not a taking of land within the meaning of the  *Expropriation Act*. Further, in my opinion, the respondents did not establish either the loss of virtually all rights of ownership, or that the Province had acquired any land as a result of the designation. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the respondents’ action.

**III. Analysis:**

**(a) De facto Expropriation:**

[6] The respondents’ claim that what was, in form, a designation of their land under the *Beaches Act* is, in fact, a taking of their land by a statutory authority within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. This claim of *de facto* expropriation, or as it is known in United States constitutional law, regulatory taking, does not have a long history or clearly articulated basis in Canadian law. We were referred to only three Canadian cases in which such a claim was made successfully, only two of which dealt with the expropriation of land.

[7] The scope of claims of *de facto* expropriation is very limited in Canadian law. They are constrained by two governing principles. The first is that valid legislation (primary or subordinate) or action taken lawfully with legislative authority may very significantly restrict an owner’s enjoyment of private land. The second is that the Courts may order compensation for such restriction only where authorized to do so by legislation. In other words, the only questions the Court is entitled to consider are whether the regulatory action was lawful and whether the *Expropriation Act* entitles the owner to compensation for the resulting restrictions.

[8] *De facto* expropriation is conceptually difficult given the narrow parameters of the Court’s authority which I have just outlined. While *de facto* expropriation is concerned with whether the “rights” of ownership have been taken away, those rights are defined only by reference to lawful uses of land which may, by law, be severely restricted. In short, the bundle of rights associated with ownership carries with it the possibility of stringent land use regulation.

[9] I dwell on this point because there is a rich line of constitutional jurisprudence on regulatory takings in both the United States and Australia which is sometimes referred to in the English and Canadian cases dealing with *de facto* expropriation: see for example *Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd.*, [1960] A.C. 490 (U.K. H.L.). The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (which also applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. In the Australian Constitution, section 51(xxxi) prohibits the acquisition of property except upon just terms. While these abundant sources of case law may be of assistance in developing the Canadian law of *de facto* expropriation, it is vital to recognize that the question posed in the constitutional cases is fundamentally different.

[10] These U.S. and Australian constitutional cases concern constitutional limits on legislative power in relation to private property. As O’Connor, J. said in the United States Supreme Court case of *Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel*, 118 S. Ct. 2131 (U.S. Mass. 1998), the purpose of the U.S. constitutional provision (referred to as the “takings clause”) is to prevent the government from “... forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” Canadian courts have no similar broad mandate to review and vary legislative judgments about the appropriate distribution of burdens and benefits flowing from environmental or other land use controls. In Canada, the courts’ task is to determine whether the regulation in question entitles the respondents to compensation under the *Expropriation Act*, not to pass judgment on the way the Legislature apportions the burdens flowing from land use regulation.

[11] In this country, extensive and restrictive land use regulation is the norm. Such regulation has, almost without exception, been found not to constitute compensable expropriation. It is settled law, for example, that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation. As expressed in Ian MacF Rogers, *Canadian Law of Planning and Zoning* (looseleaf, updated to 1999) at s.5.14, “The law permits the appropriation of prospective development rights for the good of the community but allows the property owner nothing in return.” Numerous cases support this proposition including *Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd.* (supra) and *Calgary (City) v. Hartel Holdings Co.*, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 337 (S.C.C.). Many others are reviewed by Marceau, J. in *Alberta (Minister of Public Works, Supply & Services) v. Nilsson* (1999), 67 L.C.R. 1 (Alta. Q.B.) at para 35 ff. I would refer, as well, to the following from E.C.E. Todd, *The Law of Expropriation in Canada*, (2nd, 1992) at pp. 22-23:

> Traditionally the property concept is thought of as a bundle of rights of which one of the most important is that of user. At common law this right was virtually unlimited and subject only to the restraints imposed by the law of public and private nuisance. At a later stage in the evolution of property law the use of land might be limited by the terms of restrictive covenants.

> Today the principal restrictions on land use arise from the planning and zoning provisions of public authorities. *By the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers* in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. “Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down ... (but) a taker may not, through the device of zoning, depress the value of property as a prelude to compulsory taking of the property for a public purpose.: ..... (emphasis added)

[12] The point is illustrated by *Salvation Army, Canada East v. Ontario (Minister of Government Services)* (1986), 53 O.R. (2d) 704 (Ont. C.A.). The appellant owned roughly 98 acres of land. A permanent limited interest was expropriated for running high voltage electric transmission lines and the effect of this taking was to divide the property in two. The property (except 18 acres) was also included in the Parkway Belt West Plan, with the result that part of the northern 50 acres was designated for highway and public utility purposes and the rest for uses “complimentary” to the plan. Complimentary uses did not include residential or any other substantial development. The purposes of the Parkway Belt West planning process was based on four principles:

1. To define and separate communities and thus provide people with a sense of community identity.

2. To link communities with service corridors which can facilitate the movement of peoples, goods, energy and information without disrupting community integrity, shape or function.

3. To provide a land reserve for the future anticipating land uses which cannot be foreseen today.

4. To offer open space and recreational facilities where they are most needed; right at the back doors of our urban complexes.

[13] The issue in the case was whether compensation was owed for the Parkway designation in addition to that payable for the taking for the transmission lines. The Parkway designation resulted in the decline in market value of $62,000 per acre to $10,000 per acre.

[14] The Court unanimously held that no compensation relating to the designation was payable. Grange, J.A. said at pp. 708-709:

> In law, there can be no compensation for “down-zoning” such as resulted from the Parkway Plan. As Estey, J. put it in *The Queen in right of British Columbia v. Tener et al.*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 at p. 557, 32 L.C.R. 540 at p. 345, 17 D.L.R. (4th) 1: “Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down.”

> *Although there may be (indeed there is) a presumption in favour of compensation where a statute authorizes expropriation, the compensation itself must be found in a statute … The claim must be based on expropriation of the land or upon injury to land by the expropriation of other land … Injurious affection cannot be taken to include any diminution in value totally unrelated to the expropriation and caused by down-zoning.*(emphasis added)

[15] To substantially similar effect, Finlayson, J.A., (Zuber, J.A., concurring) said at pp. 717-718:

> The real complaint of the Salvation Army relates to the Parkway Belt West Plan and its effect on land values, but *it is well accepted that such a plan does not give rise to compensation provided the planning authority acts in good faith.* I rely for this statement, as did my brother Grange, upon the statement of Estey J. in *The Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Tener et al.*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 at p. 557, 32 L.C.R. 340 at p. 345, 17 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at p. 7: “Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down.”

> That this has been the law for some time is clear from an examination of decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada starting with *Soo Mill & Lumber Co. Ltd. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie*, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 78, 47 D.L.R. (3d) 1, 2 N.R. 429, where Chief Justice Laskin in dealing with the *Planning Act of Ontario*, rejected the appellant’s assertion of invalidity on the grounds that the by-law of the municipality was prohibitory of the use of the land. He stated that a freeze on development following the precepts of an official plan and an implementing zoning by-law are permitted where no bad faith is shown …

> In *Sunbay Developments Ltd. v. City of London*, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 485, 45 D.L.R. (3d) 403, 2 N.R. 422, Chief Justice Laskin stated that it was open to the respondent city to freeze development. As the policy pursued by it was clear and within its powers, the mere addition in a holding regulation of superfluous words dealing with the future amendment of the by-law should not be taken to invalidate the effective words in the holding regulation.

> In *Hartel Holdings Co. Ltd. v. Council of City of Calgary*, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 337, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 321, [1984] 4 W.W.R. 193, Madam Justice Wilson, speaking for the Supreme Court of Canada, dealt with an appellant in Calgary who complained that its lands had been effectively sterilized by being designated as a proposed park. It offered to sell its lands to the municipality, but the price offered by the municipality was not acceptable. The appellant then brought an application for an order directing the municipality to expropriate it; it failed.

[16] In light of this long tradition of vigorous land use regulation, the test that has developed for applying the *Expropriation Act* to land use restrictions is exacting and, of course, the respondents on appeal as the plaintiffs at trial, had the burden of proving that they met it. In each of the three Canadian cases which have found compensation payable for *de facto* expropriations, the result of the governmental action went beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property. In  *British Columbia v. Tener*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 (S.C.C.), the denial of the permit meant that access to the respondents’ mineral rights was completely negated, or as Wilson, J. put it at p. 552, amounted to total denial of that interest. In *Casamiro Resource Corp. v. British Columbia (Attorney General)* (1991), 80 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (B.C. C.A.), which closely parallels Tener, the private rights had become “meaningless”. (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.) In *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R.* (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.), the legislation absolutely prohibited the claimant from carrying on its business.

[17] In reviewing the *de facto* expropriation cases, R.J. Bauman concluded, and I agree, that to constitute a *de facto* expropriation, there must be a confiscation of “... all *reasonable* private uses of the lands in question.”: R.J. Bauman, "Exotic Expropriations: Government Action and Compensation" (1994), 54 *The Advocate* 561 at 574. While there is no magic formula for determining (or describing) the point at which regulation ends and taking begins, I think that Marceau, J.’s formulation in *Nilsson* is helpful. The question is whether the regulation is of “sufficient severity to remove virtually all of the rights associated with the property holder’s interest.” (at para 48).

[18] Considerations of a claim of *de facto* expropriation must recognize that the effect of the particular regulation must be compared with reasonable use of the lands in modern Canada, not with their use as if they were in some imaginary state of nature unconstrained by regulation. In modern Canada, extensive land use regulation is the norm and it should not be assumed that ownership carries with it any exemption from such regulation. As stated in *Belfast (City)*, there is a distinction between the numerous “rights” (or the “bundle of rights”) associated with ownership and ownership itself. The “rights” of ownership and the concept of reasonable use of the land include regulation in the public interest falling short of what the Australian cases have called deprivation of the reality of proprietorship: see e.g. *Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd. v. Australia (Commonwealth)* (1996), 190 C.L.R. 513 (Australia H.C.) at p. 633. In other words, what is, in form, regulation will be held to be expropriation only when virtually all of the aggregated incidents of ownership have been taken away. The extent of this bundle of rights of ownership must be assessed, not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put. It seems to me there is a significant difference in this regard between, for example, environmentally fragile dune land which, by its nature, is not particularly well-suited for residential development and which has long been used for primarily recreational purposes and a lot in a residential subdivision for which the most reasonable use is for residential construction.

[19] Claims of *de facto* expropriation may be contrasted with administrative law challenges to the legality or appropriateness of planning decisions. For example, zoning by-laws may be attacked as *ultra vires* if they are enacted for a confiscatory or other improper purpose if such purpose is not one authorized by the relevant grant of zoning power: see e.g. *Columbia Estate Co. v. Burnaby (District)* (1974), 49 D.L.R. (3d) 123 (B.C. S.C.). The issue in such cases is not whether the by-law effects an expropriation within the meaning of expropriation legislation but whether its true purpose is a lawful purpose. Similarly, where an administrative tribunal is empowered to approve or disapprove municipal planning decisions, drastic impact on land use or value may be used as a relevant consideration: see e.g. *Nepean Restricted Area By-law 73-76*, *Re* (1978), 9 O.M.B.R. 36 (O.M.B.) at 55. In neither sort of case is the land owner claiming compensation under expropriation legislation, but rather, is attacking the legality or soundness of a land use regulation decision with respect to which the severity of the restriction falling short of extinguishment of virtually all rights of ownership may be relevant. Where, as in this case, however, such a claim for compensation is made, the claimants must bring themselves within the definition of expropriation under the statute conferring compensation. As noted, the test is exacting. Both the extinguishment of virtually all incidents of ownership and an acquisition of land by the expropriating authority must be proved.

**(b) The Effects of Regulation:**

[20] In my opinion, where a regulatory regime is imposed on land, its *actual application* in the specific case must be examined, not the potential, but as yet unexploited, range of possible regulation which is authorized. This point is demonstrated by the *Tener* case. The Court was clear in that case that the taking occurred as a result of the denial of the permit, not by the designation under the  *Park Act* which required the permit to be obtained.

[21] The American constitutional cases have recognized the importance of looking at the actual application of the regulatory scheme as opposed simply to its potential for interference with the owner’s activities. The U.S. Supreme Court requires in regulatory takings cases that there be a final decision regarding the application of the challenged regulations to the property: see *Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency*, 117 S. Ct. 1659 (U.S. Nev. 1997), at 1664-5. This rule is based on the common sense proposition that a “... Court cannot determine whether a regulation has gone ‘too far’ unless it knows how far the regulation goes”: see *MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County*, 106 S. Ct. 2561 (U.S. Cal. 1986). In my view, the same principle applies to claims of *de facto* expropriation in Canada.

[22] The declaration sought and granted by the trial judge in this case was that the designation of the lands pursuant to the *Beaches Act* constituted an expropriation within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. In my opinion, this was an error. While the act of designation imposes on the respondents’ lands a regulatory regime, that does not, of itself, constitute an expropriation. One of the respondents’ main complaints is that they were refused permission to build dwellings on the lands. That refusal was not an inevitable consequence of the designation of the lands as a beach, but flowed from the refusal by the Minister of permission required to develop the lands pursuant to s. 6 of the Regulations. If permission to build had been granted, would the designation have effected a *de facto* expropriation? The answer, I think, is self-evidently no. It was not, therefore, the designation alone that was crucial, but the designation in combination with the refusal of permission to develop the lands by building dwellings.

[23] My determination that the trial judge erred in this way does not resolve the appeal. The broader question of whether the designation, *together with* the decisions made under the regulatory regime it imposed, constitute an expropriation was argued at trial and in this Court. That broader question is, therefore, properly before us.

**(c) Is loss of economic value loss of land under the *Expropriation Act*?**

[24] The trial judge found that the respondents had been deprived of land. His main conclusion appears to have been that the loss of “virtually all economic value” constituted the loss of an interest in land. He also found, however, that the “... fee simple in the [respondents’] lands has been stripped of its whole bundle of rights.” Both aspects of his holding are before us in this appeal and, in my respectful view, both are in error.

[25] The judge found as a fact that the plaintiffs had lost virtually all economic value of their lands. That is a question of fact. The trial judge decided to accept the evidence of the respondents’ expert, Mr. Hardy, on this point. While there was some attempt to attack it in this Court, I conclude that the finding is reasonable and supported by the evidence at trial and should not, therefore, be disturbed on appeal.

[26] The judge further found that the loss of virtually all economic value was the loss of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. This holding contains two key elements: that the loss of all economic value is the loss of land within the meaning of the *Act*, and further, that the loss of virtually all economic value is a taking of land as those phrases appear in the *Expropriation Act*.

[27] I will address in this part of my reasons the first of these holdings. Does the loss of economic value of land constitute the loss of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*?

[28] The  *Expropriation Act* does not define land exhaustively, but states that land *includes “..any estate, term, easement, right or interest in*, to, over or affecting land”: section 3(1)(i). This provision, especially the emphasized text, suggests that a broad, non-technical approach to the definition of land was intended. This is consistent with the compensatory objectives of the *Expropriation Act* and with the long-established interpretative approach to such legislation. As Cory, J. said in *Dell Holdings Ltd. v. Toronto Area Transit Operating Authority*, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 32 (S.C.C.):

> … since the  *Expropriations Act*  is a remedial statute, it must be given a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with its purpose. Substance, not form, is the governing factor … In *Laidlaw v. Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto*, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 736, at p. 748, it was observed that “[a] remedial statute should not be interpreted, in the event of an ambiguity, to deprive one of common law rights unless that is the plain provision of the statute”.

> It follows that the *Expropriations Act* should be read in a broad and purposive manner in order to comply with the aim of the Act to fully compensate a land owner whose property has been taken.

[29] The authorities generally take an expansive view of what may constitute land for the purposes of expropriation legislation. In *Tener*, for example, there was no question that the respondents’ interest in minerals was an interest in land. Estey, J. held that the respondents’ rights included a grant of all minerals in the lands with the right to remove same and that denial of access to the lands so as to preclude access to the minerals was, in effect, a reduction of the property rights which were granted to the respondents. In her concurring judgment, Wilson, J. (Dickson C.J.C. concurring) based her conclusion on a different analysis. She held that “... the absolute denial of the right to go on the land and sever the minerals so as to make them their own deprives the respondents of their *profit à prendre*. Their interest is nothing without the right to exploit it. The minerals *in situ* do not belong to them. Severance and the right of severance is of the essence of their interest.”

[30] Similarly, this Court in *Harris v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Lands & Forests)* (1975), 11 N.S.R. (2d) 361 (N.S. C.A.) commented at p. 380:

> The *Expropriation Act* [as it then stood] (s. 1) gives “due compensation for any damages necessarily resulting from the exercise” of expropriation powers but gives that compensation only to “the owner of *land* entered upon, taken or used ... or injuriously affected” (italics added). The key word “land” is defined by s. 1(c):

	> (c) ‘land’ includes any estate, term, easement, right or interest to, over, or affecting land.

> This extended definition clearly covers more than traditional estates, such as a fee simple or a life estate, and more than options or other “interest in land” to which the rule against perpetuities may apply. It also includes “any ... right ... affecting land”, a phrase broad enough to cover rights such as Kenman’s first refusal right. It would be unthinkable that such a valuable right could be wiped out without compensation: the wide definition of “land” prevents that result.

> See also *Steer Holdings Ltd. v. Manitoba*, [[1992] 2 W.W.R. 558 (Man. Q.B.)] (*supra*) at para. 34, aff’d (1992), [1993] 2 W.W.R. 146 (Man. C.A.).

[31] While the term “land” must be given a broad and liberal interpretation, the interpretation must also respect the legislative context and purpose. As I will develop below, the *Expropriation Act* draws a line, on policy grounds, between the sorts of interference with the ownership of land that are compensable under the *Act* and those which are not. That line, in general, is drawn where land is taken. In interpreting where this line falls, the Court must give the term a meaning which is both consistent with the *Act*’s remedial nature but also with appropriate regard to the legal context in which the term was adopted. It is not the Court’s function, as it would be if applying a constitutional guarantee of rights of private property, to evaluate the legality or fairness of where the legislature has drawn that line, but to interpret and apply it.

[32] Kroft, J. in *Steer Holdings Ltd.*, supra, at para. 34 sounded a note of caution in this regard in his discussion of *Tener* and *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*. He emphasized that while both of those decisions gave a liberal interpretation to the kinds of property rights which may become the object of a claim for compensation, both reinforced the point that prohibition of uses or dissipation in value is not necessarily a taking.

[33] To the same effect, the House of Lords in *Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd.*, drew a distinction between the aggregated rights (or “bundle of rights”) which, *together*, constitute ownership and each particular right taken individually. As Viscount Simonds stated, at p. 517, any one of the rights which, in the aggregate constitute ownership cannot itself and by itself aptly be called property. It follows, as he noted, that the right to use property in a particular way is not, itself, property. In my view, this comment is even more apt where, as here, the issue is whether such a loss constitutes the loss of land.

[34] Reliance was placed on *Tener* for the proposition that loss of economic value of land is loss of land. In my view, however, there is nothing in the judgments of either Estey or Wilson, JJ. in that case supporting this proposition. The case does stand for the proposition that whether an interest in land has been lost is to be judged by the *effect* of the regulation as opposed to its *form*. There was no transfer of ownership of the minerals in  *Tener* and it was assumed that the respondents retained legal title to them: per Estey, J. at 564. However, both judges linked their holding to the loss, in effect, of a traditionally recognized interest in land. Estey, J. characterized the lost interest as the loss of access to the mineral rights. He commented at pp. 556 and 564 that the question of the value of the remaining rights, or indeed of the rights taken, was relevant only to computing the compensation payable, *not to whether* there had been a deprivation of an interest in land. Wilson, J. went to great lengths in her judgment to characterize the lost interest as a *profit à prendre*.

[35] In *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R.*, the appellant asserted a right to compensation based on the principle that absent clear words to the contrary, a statute is not to be construed so as to take away property without compensation. The Court found there had been a taking, that there was no express provision for taking without compensation, and that compensation was, therefore, payable. The point of mentioning this is to note that the claim for compensation in that case, unlike the present one, was not based on any express statutory entitlement to compensation. The decision is some assistance in its holding that the creation by Parliament of a government corporation for the purpose of monopolizing the whole business of the appellant (and others like it) had the effect of depriving the appellant of its goodwill as a going concern and of rendering its physical assets virtually useless, and further, that the goodwill taken away constituted property of the appellant. It is clear that, as in *Tener*, it is the *effect* rather than the form of the governmental action that is considered. However, the *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* case was not concerned with whether the loss of economic value constituted the loss of an interest in land, but rather, whether there had been a loss of property. The goodwill was found to be property, not an interest in land. The case is, therefore, of limited assistance in deciding whether the loss of economic value of land is the taking of an interest in land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

[36] Some cases have interpreted *Tener* and/or *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd*. as standing for the proposition that the loss of virtually all economic value of land is the loss of an interest in land within the meaning of expropriation legislation. For example, in *Harvard Investments Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City)* (1995), 56 L.C.R. 241 (Man. C.A.), Twaddle, J.A. (writing only for himself) stated that there are two elements to a taking, the second of which he described as “the complete extinguishment of the asset’s value to the owner.” He found support for this formulation in certain words of Estey, J. in *Tener*, specifically in reference to the value of the loss of access to the minerals. Twaddle, J.A. also referred to *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, specifically to a passage in the judgment of Ritchie, J., that the effect of the legislation was to put the appellant “out of business” and render its retained physical assets “virtually useless”. However, with respect, these passages do not support Twaddle, J.A.’s conclusions. It was clear in *Tener* that it was not the loss of the economic value of the minerals that constituted the interest in land taken, but the complete inability to exercise the right of access to, or withdrawal of, the minerals. Similarly, in *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, it was not the loss of *the value* of the goodwill or the decline in value of the physical assets, but the loss of the ability to carry on the business at all that was considered by the Court to be the property taken away.

[37] We were referred to *Steer Holdings Ltd. v. Manitoba*, (*supra*), affirmed (1992), [1993] 2 W.W.R. 146 (Man. C.A.) . Kroft, J., at trial, stated, and I agree, that *Tener* and *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* made clear that a narrow or restricted definition of property should not be given but the concept should be extended to more intangible kinds of property rights and benefits. He also found, and this is the key point, *that the diminished potential for economic gain established in that case did not constitute the taking away of a property right or asset, tangible or intangible*. He reviewed in detail several authorities, including the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in *Calgary (City)*, (*supra*), standing for the proposition that land use regulation frequently requires owners to surrender some value or future value of their land with no compensation.

[38] The Court of Appeal affirmed Kroft, J.’s decision. The focus of Huband, J.A.’s judgment for the Court was on the question of whether prohibiting the construction of a structure spanning a watercourse resulted in the City acquiring a benefit; in other words, on the issue of whether there was an *acquisition* rather than on whether there was a loss. However, Huband J.A. did state that he was “... inclined to agree there was a “taking away” in the sense that the legislation limited the plaintiff in what it could do with the property.” This suggests that it was the interference with incidents of ownership rather than loss of economic value that was relevant. Huband, J.A.’s judgment does not support the proposition that loss of economic value is the loss of an interest in land.

[39] We were referred to *Casamiro Resource Corp.* and, in particular, to the statement of Southin, J.A. for the Court that the effect of the Order in Council being considered in that case reduced the “... Crown grants to meaningless pieces of paper.” However, it is clear in the judgment that the rights in issue were the same as in *Tener* and that they were, in effect, completely taken away by the Order in Council . The case, therefore, like *Tener*, does not turn on the loss of economic value.

[40] We have been referred to no Canadian case in which the decline of economic value of land, on its own, has been held to be the loss of an interest in land. Several cases, on the contrary, recognize the distinction between the value of ownership and ownership itself. This suggests that the loss of economic value of land is not the loss of an interest in land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. This conclusion is, in my view, strongly supported by the overall scheme of compensation established by the *Act* and by judicial interpretation of it.

[41] The loss of interests in land and the loss of the value of land have been treated distinctly by both the common law and the *Expropriation Act*. In my view, this distinct treatment supports the conclusion that decline in value of land, even when drastic, is not the loss of an interest in land. To understand this point, it is necessary to consider briefly compensation for “injurious affection”, that is, injury to lands retained by the owner which results from the taking.

[42] Section 26 of the *Expropriation Act* sets out the main heads of compensation payable upon expropriation:

> 26 The due compensation payable to the owner for lands expropriated shall be the aggregate of

> 	(a) *the market value of the land* or a family home for a family home determined as hereinafter set forth.

> 	(b) the reasonable costs, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to *the owner’s disturbance* determined as hereinafter set forth;

> 	(c) damages for *injurious affection* as hereinafter set forth; and

> 	(d) *the value to the owner of any special economic advantage* to him arising out of or incidental to his actual occupation of the land, to the extent that no other provision is made therefor in due compensation. (emphasis added)

[43] Pursuant to s. 30(1), compensation is payable to the owner of land for loss or damage caused by injurious affection; this is a defined term under the *Act*:

> 3(1) In this Act, …

> (h) “injurious affection” means …

> 	(ii) *where the statutory authority does not acquire part of the land of an 	owner,* (A) such *reduction in the market value* of the land of the owner, and (B) *such personal and business damages, resulting from the construction and not the use of the works by the statutory authority, as the statutory authority would be liable for if the construction were not under the authority of a statute*, … (emphasis added)

[44] Pursuant to ss. 26(c) and 30(1) and 3(1)(h), the *Act* provides for compensation to the owner of land where there has been no taking of that owner’s land. The important points are first, that compensation for injurious affection as defined in the *Act is the only instance in which compensation is provided for the loss of value of land absent the taking of an interest in land*. Second, the legislative scheme for compensation draws a sharp dividing line between loss resulting *from a taking of land* and the loss of value of land caused by other governmental activities. In short, a sharp, and in a sense, arbitrary division is made for the purposes of compensation between takings and losses caused in other ways.

[45] This distinction was noted and described by Cory, J., for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, in *Dell Holdings Ltd*. at pp. 51-52:

> The whole purpose of the *Expropriations Act* is to provide full and fair compensation to the person whose land is expropriated. *It is the taking of the land which triggers and gives rise to the right to compensation. An owner whose land is caught up in a zoning or planning process but not expropriated must simply accept in the public interest any loss that accrues from delay.* There is neither a statutory requirement nor a policy reason for employing a similar approach to compensation for losses accruing from delay when land is expropriated and for losses accruing from delay in the planning approval process when land is not taken. *Both statutory and judicial approaches to compensation are, as might be expected, very different in these two situations*. (emphasis added)

[46] As noted by Cory, J., the common law recognized this distinction. Wilson, J. described it in her concurring reasons in *Tener* at p.547-548:

> *Where land has been taken the statute will be construed in light of a presumption in favour of compensation* (see Todd, *The Law of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada*, pp. 32-33) *but no such presumption exists in the case of injurious affection where no land has been taken* (see Todd, *supra*, at pp. 292 *et seq.*; Challies, *The Law of Expropriation* (2nd ed.), pp. 132 *et seq.*). In such a case the right to compensation has been severely circumscribed by the courts (see *The Queen v. Loiselle*, [1962] S.C.R. 624) and, *although the policy considerations reflected in the restrictive approach to recovery for injurious affection simpliciter have been seriously questioned* (see Todd, “The Mystique of Injurious Affection in the Law of Expropriation” (1967), *U.B.C.L. Rev.* - C. *de* D. 125), *the concern over the indeterminate scope of the liability remains if recovery is permitted for any injury to private land resulting from the non-negligent, authorized acts of public authorities*. (emphasis added)

[47] The important point is this. While the distinction between the value of land and interests in land is, in one sense highly technical, it is, nonetheless, deeply imbedded in the scheme of compensation provided for under the *Expropriation Act*. It is fundamental to the entitlement to compensation under the *Act* claimed by the respondents. This is so because the distinction defines the line between cases in which governmental interference with the enjoyment of land is compensable under the *Act* and cases in which it is not. An impressive argument may be made supporting a broader approach to compensation for governmental interference with the enjoyment of land. The logic of drawing the line based on whether an interest in land has been lost may, as noted by Wilson, J. above, be seriously questioned. Nonetheless, the *Expropriation Act* draws the line in this way. It is, therefore, necessary to give the legislation an interpretation consistent with the words employed and the underlying policy decision which they reflect.

[48] I conclude, therefore, that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the loss of virtually all economic value of the respondents’ land, was the loss of an interest in land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

**(d) Loss of the “bundle of rights”**

[49] That brings me to the trial judge’s holding that the effect of the designation and the way it was applied here was to strip the fee simple of its whole bundle of rights. The cases have long recognized that at a certain point, regulation is, in effect, confiscation. The law insists that the substance of the situation, not simply its form, be examined. As noted in *Nilsson*, restrictions on the use of land may be so stringent and all-encompassing that they have the effect of depriving the owner of his or her interest in the land, although leaving paper title undisturbed.

[50] While the decline in economic value of land is not the loss of an interest in land, it may be *evidence* of the loss of an interest in land. As the respondents’ appraiser, Mr. Hardy, stated in his report, the value of land is a reflection of several factors, including the scope of the incidents of ownership attached to the lands in question: 

> Our consideration of the legal basis and economic factors of value in land valuation concluded that it is the rights of ownership that give land value and it is these rights that are the subject of valuation. When the rights of ownership are excessively restricted or removed, it is logical that the value of the land is diminished, destroyed or made idle.

[51] It follows that, where the effect of land use regulation is to eliminate virtually all the normal incidents of ownership, this will be reflected in the market value of the land. It is not, however, the decline in market value that constitutes the loss of an interest in land, but the taking away of the incidents of ownership reflected in that decline.

[52] We have been referred to only three Canadian cases in which compensation has been ordered where governmental regulatory action has been held to be a *de facto* expropriation: *Tener*, *Casamiro Resource Corp.* and *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* I have already reviewed these cases earlier in my reasons. Judging by these cases, *de facto* expropriations are very rare in Canada and they require proof of virtual extinction of an identifiable interest in land (or, in *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, of an interest in property).

[53] The respondents submit that the *Beaches Act* and the Regulations, coupled with the refusal of Ministerial permission for development, prohibit virtually all activities normally associated with the ownership of land. The trial judge accepted this submission.

[54] Preclusion of residential development, as proposed by the respondents, particularly on lands of this environmental sensitivity, is not, of itself, the extinguishment of virtually all rights associated with ownership. For example, *Mariner* and *20102660 N.S. Limited* proposed to build using standard concrete basements. In considering these applications, the Minister had before him the Jacques Whitford report which opined that standard concrete foundations would cause serious damage to the dune systems. Furthermore, it was clear on the evidence that the building of residences on two of the Moshers’ lots (i.e., the cemetery and garden lots) would not be permitted, quite apart from the *Beaches Act*. Yet it is not submitted that the requirements dealing with lot size and septic requirements constitute expropriation because they, in effect, prevent building residences on these lots.

[55] With respect, the trial judge erred in finding that the *Beaches Act* designation and ensuing regulation resulted in the expropriation of these two of the Moshers’ properties. Residences could not be built on them prior to the designation, and there is no evidence that permission for other uses has been refused.

[56] What of the properties for which permission to build single family dwellings was refused? The trial judge found that virtually all incidents of ownership had been removed through that refusal and the other restrictions applied to the land. With great respect to the trial judge, I disagree.

[57] Many of the restricted activities may be authorized by permit. These include most of the traditional recreational uses described by Mrs. Mosher in her evidence. However, there is no evidence that a permit has been sought for any of these kinds of activities, much less refused. That being so, it is hard to follow the respondents’ argument that all of these things are prohibited. As noted earlier, it is not the requirement to obtain a permit that constrains the enjoyment of the land, but its refusal. When, as here, the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away *all* rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its *actual application* to the lands. As stated in *MacDonald, Sommer & Frates*, supra, the Court cannot determine whether regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes.

[58] The respondents in this case proved at trial that they would not be allowed to build the proposed single family residences. With respect to three of the Mosher’s lots, there was not even an application to build; as mentioned, residential development on two of those lots was probably impossible quite apart from the designation. Some reasonable or traditional uses of this dune property may be allowed by permit. Aside from the applications to build fences, no applications for permits relating to these other uses have been made, let alone refused. The respondents had the burden of proving that virtually all incidents of ownership (having regard to reasonable uses of the land in question) have, in effect, been taken away. Neither the respondents nor the Province appear to have explored the possibility that development specifically designed in a way consistent with protection of the dunes might occur. The respondents, while asserting that all reasonable uses of the land are precluded by the operation of the *Act* and Regulations, have not shown that they would be denied the required permits with respect to such other reasonable or traditional uses of the lands. In short, there is an absence of evidence relating to environmentally appropriate development plans on the land in question, and an absence of evidence of refusal of permission for the respondents to engage in other reasonable or traditional uses. These, in combination, result, in my opinion, in the respondents having failed to establish that virtually all incidents of ownership have, by the effect of the *Act* and Regulations, been taken away.

[59] I would conclude, therefore, that the respondents failed to establish that they had been deprived of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

**(e) Acquisition of Land**

[60] As noted, there must not only be a taking away of land from the owner but also the acquisition of land by the expropriating authority for there to be an expropriation within the meaning of the *Act*.

[61] There is no suggestion here that the Province acquired legal title or any aspect of it. The land remains private property although subject to the regulatory regime established by the *Beaches Act*. The argument is that the effect of the regulatory scheme is, for practical purposes, the acquisition of an interest in land.

[62] The respondents submit (and the trial judge held) that *Tener* stands for the proposition that where regulation enhances the value of public land, the regulation constitutes the acquisition of an interest in land. I disagree.

[63] In my respectful view, *Tener*, is, at best, equivocal on this point. When the judgments in *Tener* are read in their entirety and in light of the facts of the case, there is no support for the proposition on which the respondents rely. It is clear in the judgments of both Estey, J. and Wilson, J. in  *Tener* that what was, in effect, acquired in that case was the reversion of the mineral interests which had been granted by the Crown. Estey, J. stated that “[e]xpropriation ... occurs if the Crown ... acquires from the owner an interest in property.” He added that the acquisition of the “outstanding interest” of the respondents was a step in the establishment of the Park. He concluded that “[t]he denial of access to these lands occurred under the *Park Act* and *amounts to a recovery by the Crown of a part of the right granted to the respondents in 1937*.”In other words, the effect of the regulatory scheme was not only to *extinguish* the mineral rights of the respondents, but to re-vest them in the Crown. Similarly, Wilson, J. held that the effect of the denial of access was to remove an encumbrance from the Crown’s land. She stated that “... what in effect has happened here is *the derogation by the Crown from its grant of the mineral claims to the respondents’ predecessors in title* ... it is nonetheless a derogation of the most radical kind one which ... amounts to a total denial of that interest”.

[64] The respondents place great weight on comments of Estey, J. In *Tener* to the effect that the action taken by the government was to enhance the value of the park. These comments, while on their face supportive of the respondents’ position, must be read in the context of Estey, J.’s statements in the case that an expropriation necessarily involves the acquisition of land and that the extinguishment of the Teners’ mineral rights constituted, in effect, the re-acquisition of such rights by the Crown. I do not think, with respect, that his statements to the effect that the re-acquisition enhanced the value of the park takes away from his holding that the Crown re-acquired in fact, though not in law, the mineral rights which constituted land under the applicable definition. I am supported in this view by Wilson, J.’s unequivocal statements to similar effect with regard to the respondents’ *profit à prendre*.

[65] The respondents also rely heavily on *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*. In my opinion, their reliance on that case is misplaced. The crucial element in that case was that the same legislative scheme that deprived the company of its goodwill also conferred a monopoly to conduct the same business on the new corporation. The Court not only held that there had been a deprivation but also, in effect, a transfer of the goodwill to the new corporation. Ritchie, J., for the Court, noted that it was conceded in that case that the legislation had resulted in depriving the company of its business; the basic contention of the Crown was that the business *was not taken away by the Crown or the new corporation*. This contention was rejected by the Court. At p. 468, Ritchie J stated that:

> 	Once it is accepted that the loss of the goodwill of the appellant’s business which was brought about by the Act and by the setting up of the Corporation was a loss of property and that *the same goodwill was by statutory compulsion acquired by the federal authority*. It seems to me to follow that the appellant was deprived of property which was acquired by the Crown. (emphasis added)

[66] It is true that, as the respondents submit, the goodwill did not flow to the Crown but to the new corporation. However, the new corporation was created by federal legislation as part of the monopoly scheme and was admitted to be an agent of the federal Crown: see p. 463. The Supreme Court of Canada, not surprisingly, did not draw a distinction between the corporation created by the Crown as its agent and the Crown itself in these circumstances. The crucial point, to my way of thinking, is that the asset which was, in effect, lost by *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* was the asset gained, in effect, by the new federal corporation.

[67] The respondents also rely on the decision at trial in *Casamiro Resource Corp. v. British Columbia (Attorney General*) (1990), 43 L.C.R. 246 (B.C. S.C. [In Chambers]), at 248. The learned trial judge in that case stated, relying on *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, *supra*,
that whether the Crown acquired the mineral rights or not was irrelevant. There is no discussion of this point in the judgment on the appeal to which I have referred above. While not doubting the result in *Casamiro Resource Corp.*, which was upheld on appeal, this statement of the trial judge in *Casamiro Resource Corp.* is, with respect, clearly wrong. Contrary to what his statement suggests, for there to be an expropriation, there must be an acquisition as well as a *deprivation*. Moreover, the reliance on *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* for a contrary position by the trial judge in *Casamiro Resource Corp.* is, with respect, misplaced for the reasons I have already developed. As noted, there was in *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* an acquisition, in effect, of the goodwill by the federal authority.

[68]  I conclude that for there to be a taking, there must be, in effect, as Estey, J. said in *Tener*, an acquisition of an interest in land and that enhanced value is not such an interest.

[69] The respondents further submit that their lands have been effectively pressed into public service and that this is sufficient to constitute an acquisition of land. The judgment of the United States Supreme Court in *Lucas v. South Carolina*, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (U.S. S.C. 1992) is relied on. I do not think that case assists us here.

[70] The U.S. constitutional law has, on this issue, taken a fundamentally different path than has Canadian law concerning the interpretation of expropriation legislation. In U.S. constitutional law, regulation which has the effect of denying the owner all economically beneficial or productive use of land constitutes a taking of property for which compensation must be paid. Under Canadian expropriation law, deprivation of economic value is not a taking of land, for the reasons I have set out at length earlier. It follows that U.S. constitutional law cases cannot be relied on as accurately stating Canadian law on this point. Moreover, in U.S. constitutional law, as I understand it, deprivation of property through regulation for public purposes is sufficient to bring a case within the constitutional protection against taking for “public use”, unlike the situation under the *Expropriation Act* which requires the taking of land. It is not, as I understand it, necessary in U.S. constitutional law to show that the state acquires any title or interest in the land regulated. For these reasons, I conclude that the U.S. takings clause cases are not of assistance in determining whether there has been an acquisition of land within the meaning of the *Nova Scotia Expropriation Act*.

[71] On this aspect of the case, Australian constitutional law is of more assistance. As noted, s. 51 (xxxi) of the Australian Constitution prohibits the acquisition of property on other than just terms. The focus of the prohibition is on *acquisition*, rather than *taking* with the result that the Australian cases, unlike most of the U.S. takings clause cases, have addressed in detail what is required for there to be an acquisition. For example, in *Australia (Commonwealth) v. Tasmania* (1983), 158 C.L.R. 1 (Australia H.C.) three members of the High Court of Australia (Mason, Murphy and Brennan, JJ.) held that a federal statute which had the effect of preventing development on the land in question without the Minister’s approval, enacted to protect and conserve the land for cultural and environmental reasons, did not constitute an acquisition of property. Mason, J. at para. 70 of his reasons, put it this way: 

> 	The effect of s. 9, and perhaps to a lesser extent, of ss. 10 and 11, is to prevent any development of the property in question, subject to the Minister’s consent, so as to preserve its character as a wilderness area. ..... *In terms of its potential for use, the property is sterilized, in much the same way as a park which is dedicated to public purposes or vested in trustees for public purposes, subject, of course, to such use or development as may attract the consent of the Minister. In this sense, the property is “dedicated” or devoted to uses, that is, protection and conservation which, by virtue of Australia’s adoption of the Convention and the legislation, have become purposes of the Commonwealth. However, what is important in the present context is that neither the Commonwealth nor anyone else acquires by virtue of the legislation a proprietary interest of any kind in the property*. (emphasis added)

[72] Brennan, J. expressed the same conclusion as follows at para. 94:

> In the present case the Wilderness Regulations and *ss. 9*, *10* and *11* of *the Act* affect the freedom of the State of and of the HEC to use the Wild Rivers National Park and the HEC land for the construction of the proposed dam. But that is not sufficient to attract the operation of par. (xxxi). *Unless proprietary rights are acquired, par. (xxxi) is immaterial to the validity of the impugned Commonwealth measures. Though the Act conferred a power upon the Minister to consent to the doing of acts which were otherwise prohibited on or in relation to land, that power was not a proprietary right*. In my opinion, the Commonwealth acquired no property from Tasmania. (emphasis added)

[73] These comments are particularly significant for Canadian expropriation law because the Australian High Court has found there to be an acquisition of land in a case roughly parallel to *Tener*. In *Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd. v. Australia (Commonwealth*) (*supra*), at p. 633 the issue was whether the prohibition of mining in a national park constituted an acquisition of the appellant Newcrest’s mining leases. Justice Gummow, expressing the majority view on this issue, accepted the submission of the appellants that the state acquired “identifiable and measurable advantages” consisting of acquisition of the land “freed from the rights of Newcrest to occupy and conduct mining operations thereon.”: at pp. 69-70. Fundamental to this decision, as was the case in *Tener*, is that the sterilization of the mining leases, in effect, removed a limitation on the legal interest in the land which the Commonwealth owned subject to that interest. There was in *Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd.*, as in *Tener*, an acquisition, in effect, of some identifiable interest in land.

[74] Returning to the respondents’ submissions in this case, in my opinion, the freezing of development and strict regulation of the designated lands did not, of itself, confer any interest in land on the Province or any other instrumentality of government. I am reinforced in this opinion by many cases dealing with zoning and other forms of land use regulation. Estey, J., in *Tener*, notes that ordinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down. The Supreme Court of Canada in *Dell Holdings Ltd.*, *supra*, accepted the general proposition that, under our law, owners caught up in the zoning or planning process, but not expropriated, must simply accept the loss (provided, of course, that the regulatory actions are otherwise lawful). Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation: for a review of the authorities, see *Nilsson*, *supra*. One of the bases of these decisions is that the restriction of development generally does not result in the acquisition of an interest in land by the regulating authority.

[75] There was no evidence that the economic value of the Crown’s land was enhanced. Even if its value could be considered to be enhanced in some other sense, such enhancement, in my view, is not an acquisition of land for the purposes of the *Expropriation Act*.

[76] I conclude that the trial judge erred on this aspect of the case. In my respectful view, regulation enhancing the value of public property, if established, is not an acquisition of “land” within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

**(f) The Section 12 Argument**

[77] The appellant also submits that even if there was an expropriation, compensation is precluded by s. 12 of the *Beaches Act*. In my view, the short answer to that argument is found in ss. 4(1) and (3) of the *Expropriation Act*. Even assuming a direct conflict between s. 12 of the *Beaches Act* and s. 24 of the *Expropriation Act*, ss. 4(1) and (3) of the latter *Act*, in my opinion, make it clear that the provisions of the *Expropriation Act* apply. Had I found there to have been an expropriation, s. 12 of the *Beaches Act*, in my opinion, would not preclude compensation under the *Expropriation Act*.

**IV. Disposition:**

[78] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the action. The case raises several important issues which, in my view, it was in the public interest to have resolved. For that reason, I would not disturb the trial judge’s order for costs at trial and I would make no order as to costs of the appeal.

*Appeal allowed.*
