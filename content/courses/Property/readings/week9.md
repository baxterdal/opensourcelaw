Last week, we saw that remedies in nuisance are one legal tool used by property owners—with mixed success—to stop their neighbours from adversely affecting use and enjoyment of the owner's land. Nuisance, in other words, is one means to exclude others from doing something that limits owners' freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these cases, the courts must choose not only whose rights should win out but also find some way to address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism. 

In other cases—like the one we will study this week—it is not a neighbouring landowner who is accused of infringing the plaintiff's property rights, but the state itself. This type of claim engages the state's power of *expropriation* (power to take away property rights)—in some contexts, called the power of *eminent domain*.  

In the most dramatic cases, the state exercises its expropriation power to take private title to land (for example, to build a highway or an airport). But there are many other cases in which the state leaves title in the hands of the landowner but "takes" one or more sticks in the ownership bundle by way of regulation or other legislative act. In their broadest sense, such "regulatory takings" (as they are now called) are ubiquitous, ranging from environmental regulations to building codes and zoning bylaws. Similar to claims in nuisance, these state actions have sometimes been cast as violations of claimant landowners' traditional rights of property.

A key legal issue is to what extent landowners in Canada can exclude governments from expropriating or otherwise regulating their property rights in the absence of compensation. Unlike the United States and several modern constitutional democracies, Canada lacks any constitutional protections for private property against state attempts to limit or take away those rights. Lacking such explicit protections, it has generally not been possible for claimants to invoke existing constitutional rights in ways that protect private property. 

What protections do exist mainly take the form of provincial expropriation statutes. These statutes do not prevent government from expropriating property altogether, but they do impose certain restrictions on this activity, such as that it must be undertaken for a public purpose and that adequate compensation to landowners must be paid. Such compensation is clearly required when title is taken away by the state. Much less clear is to what extent governments in Canada are responsible for compensating landowners for regulatory activity that "takes" one or more sticks in the bundle. As the United States Supreme Court observed in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*, "[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law."

A crucial moment in the history of Anglo-Canadian legal thinking on issues of expropriation came with a dispute over water rights in Ontario toward the end of the nineteenth century between the lumbering operations of one Peter McLaren and one Boyd Caldwell. Before delving into that controversy, we begin with a brief primer on property rights in water, which differ in several important ways from property in land.

### A Brief Primer on Common Law Water Rights

Common law water rights are a complex topic in their own right and tend to vary by province — we will only skim the surface here. In order to understand the setting for *McLaren v Caldwell*, below, a few basic concepts applicable to rivers in Ontario are relevant.

A ***riparian owner*** is the owner of land bounding upon a river or other watercourse. The traditional presumption of English common law is that a riparian owner owns the bed of a ***non-navigable*** river or stream to the centre of the watercourse: *ad medium filum aquae*. Consequently, a riparian owner who holds land on both sides of a river considered non-navigable owns the entire riverbed and has exclusive rights to the river's use . 

The situation is different with respect to ***navigable*** waters. If a river is navigable "in fact", then there exists a public right of navigation in that river (i.e. a right to travel over it). It is, in other words, in the nature of a public highway. Title to the beds of these rivers is vested in the Crown. 

The legal definition of what makes a river navigable or not can involve a fair degree of complexity on the facts. For our purposes, suffice to say that, in making this determination, courts will consider whether the river is navigable along its entire length—meaning that it may be deemed navigable even if points along its length (like rapids or falls) are impossible to navigate.[^nikal1996]

## Water Rights and Expropriation on the Mississipi (Ontario) River ##

[{{< figure src="/media/ragged_chutes_dam.jpg" caption="Ragged Chutes Dam on the Upper Mississipi River, constructed by Peter McLaren. <br/> Source: Cloyne and District Historical Society" link="">}}](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cdhs/31625861242)

Over the course of the nineteenth century, access to waterways in Upper Canada and elsewhere in the country became an important part of the lumber industry and a primary means to bring timber from logging operations to sawmills and other points of market. In 1847, legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:[^vict1849]

> All persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.

(Here, the term "freshets" refers to the flood of a river or stream from heavy rain or melted snow). 

A question of interpretation surrounding this provision made its way before the courts in Upper Canada in a case called *Boale v Dickson*, decided in 1863. In *Boale*, the court held that the provision above applied only to watercourses that allowed timber to be floated down them "in their natural state…without improvements". Crucially, this meant that the legislation was found not apply to non-navigable rivers where riparian owners had made them navigable exclusively by installing their own improvements.

A few decades later, after the provision above was reenacted by the Province of Ontario, the decision in *Boale v Dickson* was challenged when Boyd Caldwell & Son sought to float logs down waterways belonging to Peter McLaren—waterways which McLaren had made navigable by investing in costly improvements. 

In 1880, the lumber merchant Peter McLaren persuaded the Ontario Court of Chancery to grant an injunction restraining Boyd, Caldwell & Son from using the rivers where McLaren had made improvements on the basis of the ruling in *Boale*. On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled *Boale* and overturned the injunction against Caldwell. Ultimately, the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision interpreting the 1847 Act was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada and subsequently reinstated by the Privy Council

Meanwhile, the provincial legislature attempted to intervene in the dispute by enacting legislation in 1881 entitled *An Act for Protecting the Public Interest in Rivers, Streams and Creeks* (the *Rivers and Streams Act*). This new legislation attempted to clarify that parties in Caldwell's position did indeed have the right to use rivers like McLaren's and their associated improvements, even if they were non-navigable to begin with. 

Following enactment of the *Rivers and Streams Act*, McLaren successfully petitioned the federal government in 1881 to take the extraordinary step of unilaterally disallowing the new legislation on the basis that it unduly interfered with McLaren's property rights. In the two years following, the *Rivers and Streams Act* was twice reintroduced and disallowed by the provincial and federal governments respectively. The Act finally passed, without disallowance, in 1884. 

At the heart of this dispute was the issue of how Ontario's attempts to facilitate transportation in the lumber industry ought to be interpreted in law. Should the limitations on McLaren's rights to exclude others from using the river be seen as an expropriation by the Province? What are the legal consequences of such an interpretation?

Below are excerpts from the judgements of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada in *McLaren v Caldwell*, the *Rivers and Streams Act*, and Parliamentary debates surrounding federal disallowance of the legislation.

Spragge, CJO —

[1] The plaintiff describes himself in his bill as a lumber merchant, timber dealer, sawmiller, and lumberman, and states that the defendant carries on the same branches of business. The bill enumerates some twelve parcels of land, of which it is stated that the plaintiff is owner; and it states that he is owner also of large tracts of timber. The bill goes on to allege that the streams flowing through his parcels of land were not navigable streams, "nor floatable for logs and timber," while in the crown, nor until after the improvements set forth in the bill were made on the said streams by the plaintiff; and that in their natural and unimproved state they would not, even during freshets, permit of saw-logs or timber being floated down the same, but were useless for the purpose. And in the 10th paragraph the plaintiff thus states his rights: "The plaintiff is entitled, both as riparian proprietor and as owner in fee simple of the bed of the said streams, where they pass and flow through the said lots respectively, to the absolute, exclusive, and uninterrupted user of the said streams for all purposes not forbidden by law, and amongst other purposes, to the absolute and exclusive right to the user of the same for the purpose of floating or driving saw-logs and timber down the same." He then goes on to say that on various parts of the said streams which run and flow through lands therein described, the plaintiff and those through whom he claims have expended a large amount of money in making certain specific and very valuable improvements, which he sets out in a number of the subsequent paragraphs of the bill.

[2] The complaint is, in substance, that the defendants, having got out several thousand saw-logs, threaten and intend to avail themselves of the improvements set out in the bill; and that in floating and running the timber and logs down the stream they are interfering with and obstructing the plaintiff in floating and running down his timber and saw-logs. And he takes the ground, that the defendants in so doing are wrongfully and forcibly, and without right or colour of right, making use of the improvements made by the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, and of which the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusive and uninterrupted user.

[3] Evidence was given at great length before Proudfoot, V. C. That learned Judge considered that he ought to follow the case of *Boale v. Dickson*, 13 C. P. 337, and stated that he understood that case to determine that if any improvements are necessary to render streams floatable, the statute G. S. IJ. C. ch. 48, does not apply—that it does not alter the character of the private streams, and that the owner of the land over which the stream flows has the right to prevent intrusion upon it. Upon the evidence, he came to the conclusion that without the artificial means of which evidence was given, neither of the streams upon which improvements had been made by the plaintiff could be considered floatable, even in freshets or high water.

[4] That was the issue upon which the evidence in the cause was given, and that was the proper issue if the construction placed upon the statute ia *Boale v. Dickson* was the proper construction.

[5] Upon the appeal to this Court, it is contended that the construction placed upon the statute in *Boale v. Dickson*, was not correct. It becomes our duty, therefore, to consider and determine that question.

[6] It is obvious, from a perusal of the Acts, (which are consolidated in ch. 48 of the C. S. U. C.,) that it was the policy of the legislature to encourage the lumber trade of the province, and to preserve the fish in the streams. The Act of 1828, 9 Geo. IV. ch. 4, recites : "Whereas it is expedient and found necessary to afford facility to the inhabitants of this province engaged in the lumber trade in conveying their rafts to market, as well as for the ascent of fish, in various streams now obstructed by mill-dams." Then follow two sections, which are embodied in section 3 of the Consolidated Act.

[7] The same policy is evidenced by 12 Vic. ch. 87, the 1st section of which supplies what may be taken to have been an omission in the Act of 1828, viz., that aprons or slides to mill-dams should be so constructed as to afford sufficient depth of water for the passage of saw-logs, lumber, and timber, a provision embodied in section 4 of the Consolidated Act.

[8] Then, in section 5 of the same Act, we find enacted what is embodied in sections 15 and 16 of the Consolidated Act. The first clause of section 5 is in the same terms as section 15, beginning thus,—"And be it enacted that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw-logs," (and so to the end of section 15) "and other timber, rafts, and craft, down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets; and that no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream, prevent the passage thereof."

[9] In *Boale v. Dickson* the opinion is expressed, "that this right so given extends only to such streams as in their natural state will, without improvements, during freshets permit saw-logs, timber, &c, to be floated down them; to streams of a different class to those mentioned in the 3rd section, 'down which lumber is usually brought.'"

[10] No such qualification of the right given by section 15 is to be found in the Act, nor in any of the previous Acts thereby consolidated. There is nothing in the context of any of these Acts shewing or tending to shew that such qualification was intended; and we know, from what we find in the evidence taken in this cause, that confining the right given by section 15 to such streams as are described in the passage I have quoted from *Boale, v. Dickson*, would go far to defeat the avowed policy of the Legislature. Evidence was offered that in none of the streams in the province, in their natural state, at the date of the passing of these Acts, could saw-logs, timber, &c, be floated down without improvements, even during freshets. The evidence was stopped by the learned Vice-Chancellor upon the objection of the plaintiff's counsel after some evidence in that direction had been given. But from the evidence that was given in the cause, it is apparent that if section 15 is to be read with the qualification given to it by *Boale v. Dickson*, a very large number of the streams of the province would be excluded from its operation.

Ritchie, CJ —

[1] The bill in this case was filed in the Court of Chancery on the 4th May, 1880, on behalf of the appellant, Peter McLaren, against the respondents, B. Caldwell & Son, to restrain them passing or floating timber and saw logs through portions of the main branch of the Mississippi river and its northern tributaries, Louse creek and Buckshot creek, where these streams passed and flowed through the lands of the appellant and over the dams, slides, and improvements owned or constructed by the appellant along these streams.

[2] Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, on the 4th of May, granted an ex parte injunction to the plaintiff (appellant), and on the 21st day of May, 1880, continued the injunction until the hearing of the cause.

[3] From this decision the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, and on the 2nd of June, 1880, by a judgment of that court, the injunction granted was dissolved. The defendants thereupon answered the plaintiff’s bill in the usual course on the 11th of August, 1880. Replication was filed on the 3rd of September, 1880.

[4] The cause came on for examination of witnesses and hearing before Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, at Brockville, on the 27th of October, 1880, and afterwards at Perth, on the 8th of December, 1880, and was continued until the 16th of December, on which day the Vice-Chancellor pronounced a decree in favour of the appellant.

[5] From this decree the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and their appeal was allowed.

[6] From this decision the plaintiff now appeals to this court.

[7] At the time the bill was filed the respondents were proceeding to drive their logs, in all some 18,000 logs, through all the appellants improvements on Louse creek and Buckshot creek, and on the Mississippi, all of which flow through the lots of land of which the appellant was, and still is, the owner in fee simple.

[8] The plaintiff contends that the stream in question where it passes through his property is non-navigable, and non-floatable at all seasons of the year, — that he has, by artificial means placed on his own property, enabled lumber to float over his property through the course of said stream, and the main question at issue between the parties is this: — Has the appellant the legal right to prevent (as he seeks by his bill to do) the respondents driving their logs through his lands, and in doing so to utilize the improvements owned by him, on and along the streams in question? or, are those streams part of the public highway, and, therefore, open to the free use of the respondents in common with the appellant and the public generally?

[9] It cannot be disputed, I think, that if those portions of the streams in which plaintiff’s improvements were made, are incapable of being navigated or floated at any time of the year, and the fee simple of the beds of such streams is in plaintiff, the public at common law have no right whatever to enter on such private property, and plaintiff, having the absolute title to the same, has the sole right to deal with the bed and soil of the stream, and to place such improvements, constructions and erections thereon as he may choose. While it seems to be admitted that the public have no right to enter on such property and make improvements thereon, it is claimed that in Ontario, when streams of the character mentioned are rendered capable of being navigated through the instrumentality of such improvements made by the owner of the soil, whereby lumber can at freshet times be floated through private property, the public have an absolute common law right to use such improvements and to deal with the stream, as if the same had been naturally floatable, that is, without the aid of artificial improvements; and this right it is also claimed, is conferred on the public by virtue of the statutory enactments of the Province of Ontario.

[10] The Act 12 Vic., cap. 87, is entitled, “An Act to amend an Act passed in the Parliament of Upper Canada in the ninth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Fourth, entitled ‘An Act to provide for the construction of aprons to mill dams over certain streams in this Province, and to make further provision in respect thereof.’”

[11] Section 5 of this Act is in the following words:

> And be it enacted that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer and autumn freshets; and that no person shall, by felling trees, or placing any other obstruction in, or across such stream, prevent the passage thereof; provided always that no person using such stream, in manner and for the purposes aforesaid, shall alter, injure or destroy any dam or other useful erection in, or upon the bed, of or across any such stream, or do any unnecessary damage thereto or on the banks of such stream; provided there shall be a convenient apron, slides, gate, lock or opening in any such dam or other structure made for the passage of all saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts authorized to be floated down such streams as aforesaid.

[12] The Act 12 Vic. c. 87, remained in force until 1859, when it was repealed by Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, at page 462.

[13] It was, however, substantially re-enacted during the same year as chapter 48 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, of which Act the above section 5 is made to comprise sections 15 and 16. This Act is intituled “An Act respecting mills and mill dams.” Section 15 of chapter 48 is as follows: —

> All persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.

[14] There can be no doubt that statutes which encroach on the rights of the subject, whether as regards persons or property, should receive a strict construction, and if a reasonable doubt remains, which cannot be satisfactorily solved, the subject is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, in other words he shall not be injured or affected in his person or property, unless the intention of the Legislature to interfere with the one or take away the other is clearly and unequivocally indicated.

[15] At the very outset, if defendants’ contention can be maintained, we are met with the singular incongruity of the Legislature enacting that “it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down,” or “that all persons may float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down” streams that from the nature of the streams themselves it is impossible saw logs, &c., could be floated down; in other words it seems most unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended to legislate that it should be lawful to do what in the nature of things could not be done. Is it not much more reasonable to assume that the Legislature was dealing with a subject-matter capable of being used in the manner in which it is declared it shall be lawful to use it, and that in this view the language of the Legislature had reference to all streams on or through which saw logs and other timber, &c., could either during the spring, summer or autumn freshets be floated?

[16] The object of the Legislature was, in my opinion, in the interest of the timber business, not to interfere with or take away any private right, but to settle by statutory declaration any doubt that might exist as to streams incapable of being navigated by boats, but capable of floating property, such as saw logs and timber, only at certain seasons of the year, viz.: during spring, summer, or autumn freshets; thereby classing such streams as public highways, by adopting a test of navigability judicially recognized and acted on in the Province of New Brunswick, as far back as 1842, and in some, though not in all, of the American States, as applicable to the circumstances and necessities of this country, and which circumstances do not exist in England, where no such test prevails, thus affirming and settling a new and debatable point, viz.: the right of the public to float timber, &c., down streams floatable only in freshet times, and the Legislature having thus established the right proceeded to prevent the obstruction of the same; but, nevertherless, subject always to the restrictions imposed in respect to erections for milling purposes on such streams, and the action of the Legislature was not intended to interfere with private property and private rights in streams not by nature floatable at any season of the year.

[17] If the Legislature contemplated what is now contended for, and intended the enactment to apply to streams not-floatable at all seasons, as there is no pretence for saying that the Legislature has conferred any right on the public to enter on private property on any such non-floatable streams, and make it floatable, and as a non-floatable stream cannot be made practically floatable by operation of law, what was the specific legal right conferred on the public by the statute? Is it not obvious that the only effect of the enactment could be to confer on the public the right to use private property and the improvements made thereon by the proprietors thereof without making any compensation therefor? From this section is it possible to infer any such intention? Had any such intention been present to the mind of the Legislature it should have been, and I think it would have been, clearly and unequivocally expressed. To attribute to the Legislature an intention so unreasonable and unjust is not justifiable unless the language is so direct and unambiguous as to admit of no doubt or other construction.

[18] I am at a loss to appreciate the force of the illustration given by Mr. Justice Patterson of the statutory highways of Ontario, as being at all analogous to the case of non-floatable streams. It seems entirely to beg the question. No doubt, if the Legislature had, in so many words, declared all streams, whether or not navigable or floatable, common or public highways, then doubtless the improvements or the removal of obstructions on such common or public highways, could in no way interfere with their common and public character. But this leaves us just where we were, and in no way that I can see solves the question we have to determine, viz.: whether or not the Legislature has so declared streams not floatable, public highways. It may so happen, and no doubt has happened, that in grants of land, allowances for roads therein dedicated as highways, on actual survey, and on the laying out of the roads, have proved, from the natural character of the ground, impassable as highways. But it is clear that any such case must be exceptional and accidental.

[19] It cannot, I think, be supposed that the Legislature would, knowingly, dedicate by law, over private property, common and public highways, which could never be used as such by reason of the land being by nature totally unfit for and impassable as a highway. On the same principal, it seems to me as equally unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended simply to declare it lawful for all persons to float sawlogs down streams in freshet times, through which, at such times, no logs could by any possibility be floated. I am likewise quite at a loss to understand how such a mere declaration, impossible to be acted on, could encourage the lumber trade or afford any facilities to parties engaged in the lumber trade in conveying their rafts to market.

[20] Then as to the right to use the improvements of a proprietor by which he has made the stream floatable. The proprietor of a non-floatable stream who makes it floatable for his own use, does no more than if he made a canal through his property. He does not interfere with his neighbour; he takes nothing from the public, who can neither use the stream as it is, nor improve it, except by the permission of the proprietor, and as to whom, having no right or property therein, the improvement of the proprietor does no wrong, and who are placed in no worse position by the owner’s refusal to permit them to be used than they were in if no such improvement had been made.

[21] It has been urged that to allow an individual to shut up a stream a hundred miles long because he may own small portions of the stream not floatable in a state of nature would be most unreasonable. But it seems to be forgotten that it is not the individual who shuts up the stream, it is closed by natural impediments which prevent such portions being used for floatable purposes, and as it is admitted the public have no right to enter on such portions and erect improvements whereby the stream in those parts may be made navigable or floatable by reason of the same being private property, the stream is as effectually shut up by a refusal to permit an entry and improvements to be made as if the proprietor himself made the improvements and prohibited the use thereof by the public. If the use of the non-floatable portions of a stream is as necessary for the carrying on of lumbering operations as has been urged, the obvious means of securing a right to use private improvements would be to obtain by payment of an adequate consideration the proprietor’s permission, or, if the streams are unimproved, to secure from the proprietor the privilege of making such necessary improvements, or, failing the ability to accomplish this, if the development of the public domain, the exigencies of the public, or the business of the country, is of such paramount importance in comparison with individual loss or inconvenience as to require that private rights should give way to the public necessity, the remedy must be sought at the hands of the legislature through the instrumentality of expropriation, with suitable and full compensation under and by virtue of the right of eminent domain. There is, in my opinion, nothing whatever to justify the conclusion that the legislature intended under this provision to exercise its right of eminent domain, and expropriate the property of the owners of streams not by nature navigable or floatable, or any property or improvements the owner might place or make thereon.

[22] But, in my opinion, as I have suggested, the Legislature merely intended that all streams through which lumber could pass, whether all the year round, or only during the freshet times, should, for the purposes of the lumber trade, be common and public highways, but did not intend thereby to enact that streams through which lumber could not pass, even in times of freshets, should be common and public highways, still less that sluiceways and improvements on private property, through which, in its natural state, lumber could not be passed, should become subject to public uses any more than a canal or railroad dug or constructed on private property round a natural obstruction.

Disallowance of streams bill.

Mr. McCarthy.

[1] When the House rose at six o'clock, I was proceeding to consider that part of the Bill which deals with compensation. Perhaps I might first be permitted to state, however, what I understand to be the meaning of the word "compensation," when applied to the sovereign right of expropriation. Now, I do not pretend to dispute, and I am quite willing to admit in the amplest possible manner, so far as my judgement goes, that this *Act* of Parliament was, subject to one consideration, within the power of the Local Legislature. If the one consideration be overlooked there is power in the Local Legislature as in every other sovereign body - and the Local Legislature is sovereign so far as its jurisdiction extends - to expropriate property for public purposes. But, Sir, as I understand the doctrine of expropriation, as we call it, or as it is better known on the other side of the line, the exercise of its power of eminent domain, there are two limitations to the exercise of that power.

[2] The first and most important is that it should be exercised only in the public interest. There is no right, in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, to take from one man his property and hand it over to another unless it be in the public interest.

[3] The next important qualification in the doctrine - and perhaps it is more than the other, and at all events to the individual - is that the expropriation should be only on payment of full compensation.

[4] Now, that compensation as you know, is always given where expropriation is exercised in the ordinary and familiar instances of railway companies or bridge companies. Under a *Railway Act*, before property can be taken for public purposes, the fair value of the property is to be given to the proprietor, and that fair value is arrived at in the manner pointed out by the *Act* by arbitrators selected, one by the company, one by the individual whose property is taken from him, and the third by one of the Courts of the land. But it is perfectly plain that where this doctrine is perhaps better understood than anywhere else, in the United States, no exercise of the power of eminent domain is legal or constitutional, according to their law, unless it is accompanied by compensation - payment in money at the time, not payment postponed to any future date.

[5] Now, I am not unaware that there is no such limitation in our law; I am not unaware that, according to the doctrine of the British Parliament, the power we have and the power of the Local Legislatures have in their spheres comprehends the power, though not the right, to take away a man's property without compensating him. But I challenge my hon. friends opposite to point out in the history of British legislation any instance in which the right of a person whose property is taken from him to receive compensation has been departed from. Although there is the absolute power, that power has been so exercised under our free form of government that it has not been found necessary to limit it as it is limited in the United States.

[6] Now, I wish to point out another feature of this measure - that not merely, as I shall endeavour to show, is it an exercise of the power of eminent domain without adequate and proper compensation, but it is also an Act of Parliament relating peculiarly to past events. It is retroactive in its enacting clause; it does not speak merely for the future, but it legislates for the past and thus two principles of sound legislation - principles of paramount importance - have been violated.

[7] First, property has been taken from an individual without adequate or proper compensation; and second, the *Act* is retroactive in its effect, and in point of fact, determined the litigation then existing between the parties, and which gave rise to this measure. The power of eminent domain is said to be the supreme right of property appertaining to the Sovereign - the power by which private property acquired by the citizens under the sovereign's protection - may be taken, or its use controlled for the public benefit without regard for the wishes of the owner. The doctrine is thus stated by Judge Colley:   

> It is the rightful authority which must rest in every sovereignty to regulate and control these rights of a public nature which pertain to its citizens in common, and to appropriate and control individual property for the public benefits as the public safety, convenience, or necessity may demand.

[8] The limit to that power is this:

> That compensation shall be made therefore; and this compensation must be pecuniary in its character, because it is in the nature of a payment for a pecuniary purchase.

[9] It is said by a learned Judge, in one case in which the matter was discussed, that: 

> This authority amounts to nothing more than a power to oblige a private individual to sell and convey while the public interests required it.

[10] Mr. Chancellor Kent, in his able commentaries, thus speaks of it:

> The settled and fundamental doctrine is that the Government has no right to take private property for public purposes without giving just compensation; and it seems to be necessarily implied that the indemnity should, in cases which will admit of it, be previously and equitably ascertained, and be ready for reception concurrently in point of time with the actual right of eminent domain.

[11] Again Judge Colley says: 

> While the owner is not to be disseized until compensation is provided; neither, on the other hand, when the public authorities have taken such steps as to finally settle upon the appropriation, ought to be left in a state of uncertainty to what for compensation until some future time when they may see fit to occupy it.

[12] Well, Sir, to quote once more:

> But, whatever be the necessity and however important to the public use, compensation must be made in money, and not in incidental benefits, in order to meet the true spirit of the constitutional provision upon that subject.

[13] The general rule is clear, that although steps preliminary to expropriation may be taken without providing compensation:

> Before any definite act be done towards the construction of improvement which is in the nature of the assertion of ownership, payment must be made or tendered or a certain and adequate remedy be provided, and unless that is done in the Act authorizing the work, the Statute is wholly unconstitutional and void.

[14] I have troubled the House with these extracts because I think that they lay down correct principles of legislation. I do not mean to say, Sir - and I have carefully avoided, I think, stating - that these regulations apply to our legislation here; but what I do mean to say is, that the same spirit which regulates the written law on the other side has governed and always governs British legislation. I defy my hon. friends opposite to point, in all the Statute-books of British legislation, to an *Act* of this character, intended to deprive a man of his property without giving him adequate and suitable compensation.

[15] Now, Sir, does this *Act* in any way come up to the terms of what I venture to say it should be, in order to bring it within the principles of sound legislation. The first section of the *Act* declares that notwithstanding any effect of the judgments of the Courts up to that time, all streams during the spring, summer and autumn freshets were open to everybody to float and transmit saw-logs and timber of other kinds. The second clause of the *Act* says: "that any person may go on the land and construct in any such rivers, creeks or streams any improvements he thinks proper, in order to facilitate the passage of timber." The third provision says, that the rights therein given, and the provision therein made - contained in the foregoing sections 1st and 2nd - shall extend to and apply to all rivers, creeks and streams mentioned in the 1st section of the *Act*, that is to all rivers, creeks and streams which whether floatable or navigable in the state of nature, or not, have been made floatable or navigable by artificial means by any one; and the 4th section purports, or pretends to give compensation, and how does it read? The Lieutenant Governor may fix the amount which any person collecting tolls under this *Act* shall be at liberty to charge saw logs and different kinds of timber, or rafts, or crafts, and may from time to time, vary the same; and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in fixing such tolls, is to regard certain matters.

[16] Now, how does this matter stand practically? This property is as I pointed out before Recess, when this *Act* of Parliament was passed, was the property of Mr. McLaren. On the passage of this *Act*, it ceased to be his private, and became public property. It ought not, every hon. Member, I think, will admit, to have been transferred to the public, unless the public had paid compensation for it, or unless there was certain and sure means pointed out by the Statute by which that compensation was to be recovered. I do not think that any hon. Member in this House or that any fair-minded man in this country will for one moment content, even supposing that the use of this river was all important in a public sense, even supposing that it was a great wrong on Mr. McLaren's part to use it solely for his own purposes, and denying its use for everybody else, that it ought to have been taken from him for public purposes, without his being paid a compensation for his property and proprietary rights.

[17] Well, Sir, what does this *Act* do? It says that tolls may be collected, and more, what has been done? Property which was McLaren's today was tomorrow public property. It is worth so much money call it $100,000, or anything you like, whatever it may be; but where is he to get that money, the interest on that money, or the principal. It is said he may get it by tolls. But wherein is any person compelled to use that stream? Does it follow that this stream will be used by any person? Is there any certain, sure way, such as constitutional writers point out, by which this money, or the interest or the capital, or any other compensation will be given to him for depriving him of his property, which this Statute affects.

[18] I think, Sir, it is perfectly plain that the pretence of giving him compensation is illusory. It is perfectly certain that, across the border, this State would be deemed unconstitutional and void. It is perfectly clear that the authorities say, if this law was enacted by any State of the Union, that it would be, according to their constitution - and it would be declared in the Courts in that country - void and of no effect. It is not here, because the British Parliament is omnipotent because the Legislature within its sphere, is omnipotent; because when the *Act* goes on the Statue-book, and is assented to by royal authority, it becomes the law of the land, no matter how unjust its provisions may be in depriving a man of his property and giving it up to public uses; but this is not according to the spirit of the constitution. It is not according to the way in which the laws are administered. It is not according to what is believed to be right and honest between man and man, that for public or any other purposes, a person should be despoiled of his estate.

[19] Well, Sir, my hon. friend stated it was an outrage that a man, by making an improvement upon stream or some portion of it, should close that stream, so that no person else could use it, thus he said: "The toil and labor expended in getting out timber, would be lost because it could not be got to market." As proof, and perhaps the strongest proof, I can offer to show that the Bill was undoubtedly passed for the purpose of injuring one man and enriching another, I will show the House what is perfectly well known to every man engaged in the lumber business, that there was no necessity for this legislation at all. If it was essential in the public interest that this river should be open to the public, Sir, there is a law on the Statute-book of the Province of Ontario, which is referred to in this *Act*, and which says that any five men can by taking certain steps become incorporated, and being incorporate, may acquire from any proprietor improvements on any river or stream; that they may expropriate; that upon payment, just as a railway company can, they can expropriate the river improvements, on the payment of the just value, and can hold the stream and collect tolls and work them, if they find it profitable.

[20] Well, Sir, what are we forced to think? Either that Caldwell could not get any other four persons to join him in expropriating this property, that he knew it would not pay him to do so, or that it would not pay for the investment of the capital necessary, or that the Local Government, in order to favor one man, their supporter, deliberately passed this *Act* of Parliament to deprive McLaren of his property, and, in point of fact, to hand it over to one other person who desired to use the stream, and this was Caldwell. Another statement has been made, and a good deal has been attempted to be made of it; it is this: that Caldwell was practically denied the right to bring his timber to market by this stream. If this were so, it would not be any justification for such an *Act* of Parliament. But the contrary is the fact. The limit belonging to Caldwell, was worked long before Caldwell had it. It was, and had been, the property of Hon. Mr. Skead, and during the time he worked it he took the timber from it by its natural waters, the Madawaska, which are the nearest and most convenient; and the only fact which makes the Mississippi more convenient for Caldwell is because he happens to have a mill at Carleton Place on that stream.

[21] This being the condition of affairs, what was to be done? Here was a Statute, which I think I have shown was intended to deprive one man of his rights without compensation, there are no constitutional safeguards, such as they have on the other side of the line, by which an appeal could be made to the Courts of the land. Here was a Statue, retroactive in its operations, which declared that what was law yesterday in the Province of Ontario shall cease to be law tomorrow. The effect of that was to interfere with litigation, and to take from the man his property and his right. And what appeal had he? Why, he had the appeal to the foot of the throne. The only redress that was left to him, as a British subject, was to go with his petition to the representative of the Throne in this country - to His Excellency the Governor General - and point out to him how the matter stood, and ask His Excellency under the circumstances, to disallow the measure. Was that wrong? Is it to be said that, in no case, under no circumstances, can an Act of Parliament, which is within the power of a Local Legislature, be disallowed? No person pretends to assert that doctrine, though I believe the resolution in your hands, Mr. Speaker, does assert it.

Mr. Blake.

[22] Yes; but the hon. Gentleman went a good deal further. What the Legislature said in this case was this: They said that they had the power to declare what the law was. They said that they knew better than others what their intention was, and that they, as the successors of the Legislature that passed that law, could declare what it was. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged frankly that we were not here, so far as we can interfere with private rights, to do so; but that the Local legislatures, in the much larger measure in which they are invested with authority to deal with private rights, are not restrained by constitutional prohibitions which render it impossible for them to do things which it is impossible for the Legislature of the Dominion to do, but he proposed to apply to the Local Legislatures the same prohibitions in effect.

[23] I will tell you, Sir, what the hon. Gentleman proposed. This is his proposition, Mr. Speaker. He says that under the *Constitution*, things, which it would be impossible for the Local Legislature effectually to deprive the subject of his property except under certain conditions and with certain restrictions, existed which did not exist here. I admit that under the *Constitution* of Canada and the Provinces, the Local Legislatures have the power to deprive the subject of his property under these conditions; but I say that if we import into our *Constitution*, into the *Constitution* of Confederation a restriction upon that power and declare it as a majority in this House propose this night to declare, we will declare it to be the right and duty of the Government wherever that power, which he admits exists, is to be exercised, to nullify its exercise by disallowing such Acts.

[24] The hon. Gentleman says that you find this in the *Constitution*. Why? You do not find it in the *Constitution*. The hon. Gentleman says that this spirit of the *Constitution* shall be violated; that the assent of the *Constitution* shall be broken, and that a new clause shall be inserted in the *Constitution*, giving you not the certainty of a Court on the point, but the discrete determination of a political body trying a case without hearing the other side, as to whether it comes within their competence, what the United States Constitution would forbid, and upon their arguments to decide that the law should be nullified.

[25] No, Sir, I am a friend to the preservation of the rights of property, not, perhaps, after the form of the hon. Gentleman, and many of the hon. Gentleman on the other side, but I believe in the subordination of those rights to the public good. Let me tell the hon. Gentleman what happened under the wholesome influences of that interpretation of the *Constitution* which he, in earlier and happier days received. Let me tell him that the discussion which took place with reference to the Smith will - to the will of Sir Henry Smith - and followed by the discussions which took place with regard to the Goodhue will, proved the importance, morally as well as materially of the possession here belonging, of the power to decide for themselves what should be right and what should be wrong in these cases. The people of Ontario and the Legislature of Ontario found, that there was to be no appeal to some good art of a machine, no appeal to some superior power, but that they had the right as a State, which each of us has as a man - the right to go wrong - and they determined to go right. A Session did not lapse after the passage of those mischievous measures - after they had become the law of the land, that Legislature at once taking steps on the resolution which I had the honour of introducing, to render practically impossible for the future any such interference as had taken place in the Goodhue and Smith will cases. They proceed to pass a law under which estate bills were to be referred to the Judges. They passed that law, and subsequently the reports of the Judges were made on all estate bills, and the opinion of the Judges was invariably accepted.

[26] The hon. Gentleman says this is an imperfect remedy; he advises that an appeal should be made to the people, and if it is impossible to obtain a satisfactory settlement in a Provincial appeal to the people on account of the other questions which would complicate it there, what does the hon. Gentleman proposes by way of remedy? Why, that it should come here to this Government, which is responsible to this Parliament, which Parliament is responsible to this whole Dominion; so that the ultimate recourse of an Ontario subject should be to the general election of the Dominion, complicated with all the issues of the general election itself. Just suppose that the action of the Government had been what it was not; suppose that the hon. Gentleman had said: "We refuse to deal with this measure;" what would have been Mr. McLaren's remedy? His remedy would have been an appeal to the people - first to Parliament, and if Parliament refused to agree with his views, then from Parliament to the people.

Sir John A MacDonald.

[27] Oh!

Mr. Blake.

[28] Well, what other remedy would he have? I know that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the remedy would be wholly inadequate. As to Mr. McLaren getting a remedy by appealing to the whole Dominion on the question whether the Government was right or wrong in disallowing this measure in his private interest, that would be quite hopeless. Therefore, this remedy, if hopeless in the Province is hopeless in the Dominion. I deny that the people of my Province are insensible to or careless about the true principles of legislation. I believe they are thoroughly alive to them, and I am content that my rights of property, humble though they are, and those of my children, shall belong to the Legislature of my country to be disposed of subject to the good sense and right feeling of that Legislature and the good sense and right feeling of the people of that Province.

[29] I do not believe his own friends will echo the shameful statement of the Secretary of State that the Act of the Legislature is an act of robbery to oblige a friend, no more than I impute to the hon. Gentleman opposite, what I might well impute after this statement, that he has disallowed an *Act* of the Local Legislature in order to oblige a friend - no more than I might impute that to him, and with infinitely greater force, because I say that he did it without giving the opposite side an opportunity to be heard.
