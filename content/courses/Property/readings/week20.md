This week we cover two topics that link back issues of exclusion we've studied throughout the course. The first topic provides a contemporary perspective on the question of *de facto* expropriation, which we first addressed in [Week 9](../week9/) and then revisited in [Week 11](../week11/). The second topic concerns the right to exclude in the context of intellectual property—namely patent rights acquired by inventors and used to exclude others from making or using that invention for some period of time. 

Through both of these topics, we continue to see the courts' turn toward a contemporary style of common law reasoning that rests on a pragmatic combination of elements from both the classical and modern perspectives. As you work through the materials this week, aim to identify where these elements of earlier styles appear and ask yourself whether their combination results in a coherent framework for legal reasoning. 

## *De Facto* Expropriation ##

Recall that a claim of *de facto* expropriation is based on the theory that government has undertaken some type of activity that falls short of taking title to land or other property, but which nevertheless is tantamount to expropriation and therefore demands compensation. Since a modern framework for claims of *de facto* expropriation was articulated in *Mariner Real Estate Ltd v Nova Scotia*, that framework was subsequently picked up and largely endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver (City)*, below. 

At roughly the same time as the Supreme Court was addressing this matter in *CPR*, another set of legal developments was also playing out at the international level under the *North American Free Trade Agreement* (*NAFTA*). *NAFTA*—an agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico—provides parallel protections for *de facto* expropriation that are afforded to foreign investors in each of the member states (e.g. Canadian investors in Mexico, or American investors in Canada). These protections, however, are not defined by Canadian domestic law on *de facto* expropriation as expressed in cases like *Mariner Real Estate* and *CPR*. Rather, they are interpreted by an international tribunal that arbitrates claims between private investors and the state party accused of violating the investor's rights. Even more recently—and in part as a response to some of the criticisms of the original NAFTA regime—the NAFTA parties negotiated a new multilateral trade agreement to replace NAFTA. This is the *Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement* (*CUSMA*), signed in 2018.

### Revisiting Blue Mountain-Birch Cove

Briefly review the facts of the [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Case study we explored in Week 11](../week11/#problem-blue-mountain-birch-cove-lakes), then consider the following questions:

- Does the decision in *Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver* strengthen the Annapolis Group's claim in *de facto* expropriation against the Halifax Regional Municipality? Why or why not?

- Suppose that Annapolis Group Inc. is a land development company incorporated in the United States or Mexico. How might the results of its claim to *de facto* (or "indirect") expropriation differ if it were to make a claim under Article 1110 of *NAFA* rather than in Canada's domestic courts (which it could still do as a legacy claim until July 2022)? How would it differ under *CUSMA*?

**McLachlin CJC**:—

**1. Introduction**

[1] Over a century ago, in 1886, the provincial Crown granted the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (”CPR”) a corridor of land for the construction of a railway line from False Creek, in the City of Vancouver (”City”), south to Steveston, on Lulu Island (named after Miss Lulu Sweet, a young actress in the first theatrical company to visit British Columbia). It is this corridor of land, now known as the “Arbutus Corridor”, that lies at the heart of this appeal.

[2] In 1902, a railway line was built on the corridor. As the century advanced, traffic declined. From time to time, there was talk of using the corridor for an urban transit line, but nothing came of it and, ultimately, the line was placed elsewhere. In 1999, CPR formally began the process of discontinuing rail operations on the corridor under the *Canada Transportation Act*, S.C. 1996, c. 10.

[3] The Arbutus Corridor has for many years been bounded on both sides and for virtually its entire length by extensive urban development. CPR put forward proposals to develop the corridor for residential and commercial purposes. It also indicated that if the City or any other public body wished to acquire the land, it was willing to sell it at whatever price was determined by agreement or expropriation.

[4] Nothing happened. With increasing vigor, CPR expressed its view that it was intolerable for the City and other governmental bodies to seek to keep the corridor intact without purchasing it. Spirited public debate ensued. The City, as early as 1986, indicated in planning documents and Council resolutions its preference to preserve the corridor for transportation purposes. In the end, the City made it clear that it would not buy the land and adopted the *Arbutus Corridor Official Development Plan By-law*, City of Vancouver, By-law No. 8249, (25 July 2000) (”ODP By-Law”), that designated the corridor as a public thoroughfare for transportation and “greenways”, like heritage walks, nature trails and cyclist paths.

[5] The City’s powers are derived from the *Vancouver Charter*, S.B.C. 1953, c. 55, an Act of the Legislature of British Columbia, which serves the same purpose as a “municipal act” but applies only to the city of Vancouver (see Appendix A). Development plans under s. 561 of the *Vancouver Charter* are essentially statements of intention which do not directly affect land owners’ property rights. However, once development plans are adopted as “official” (”ODPs”) under s. 562, they preclude development contrary to the plans: s. 563.

[6] Building on earlier planning documents, the intent of the ODP By-law was “to provide a context for the future of the [corridor]”. More particularly, s. 1.2 stated: “The Arbutus Corridor has been used for many years for a rail line and this plan accommodates this use, but also provides for a variety of other uses.”

[7] The by-law outlined the uses to which the corridor could be put (s. 2.1):

> This plan designates all of the land in the Arbutus Corridor for use only as a public thoroughfare for the purpose only of:

>> (a) transportation, including without limitations:
>>
>>> (i) rail;
>>>
>>> (ii) transit; and
>>>
>>> (iii) cyclist paths
>
> but excluding:
>
>>> (iv) motor vehicles except on City streets crossing the 	 	Arbutus Corridor; and
>>>
>>> (v) any grade-separated rapid transit system elevated, in whole or in part, above the surface of the ground, of which one type is the rapid transit system known as "SkyTrain" currently in use in the Lower Mainland;
>>
>> (b) greenways, including without limitation:
>>
>>> (i) pedestrian paths, including without limitation urban walks, environmental demonstration trails, heritage walks and nature trails; and
>>>
>>> (ii) cyclist paths.

[8] The effect of the by-law was to freeze the redevelopment potential of the corridor and to confine CPR to uneconomic uses of the land. CPR regards this effect as unfair and unreasonable. It does not allege that the City acted in bad faith. However, it argues: (1) that the by-law is *ultra vires* City and should be struck down; (2) that the City is obligated to compensate CPR for the land; and (3) that the by-law suffers from procedural irregularities and should be struck down on that account.

[9] The Chambers Judge held the by-law to be *ultra vires* the City, declined a declaration that the City must compensate CPR and found it unnecessary to consider the procedural issues ((2002), 33 M.P.L.R. (3d) 214 (B.C. S.C. [In Chambers]). The British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected all three arguments and allowed the City’s appeal ((2004), 26 B.C.L.R. (4th) 220 (B.C. C.A.)). CPR now appeals to this Court. Despite considerable sympathy for CPR’s position, I conclude that under the *Vancouver Charter*, the City was entitled to refuse compensation and to pass the by-law, and that the courts have no option but to uphold it. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

**2. Issues**

1. Was the ODP By-law beyond the statutory powers of the City?
2. If not, must the City compensate CPR for the land?
3. Should the by-law be set aside for procedural irregularities?

**3. Analysis**

**3.1 Was the By-law Beyond the Statutory Powers of the City?**

[10] The powers of the City are derived from the *Vancouver Charter*. CPR argues that the ODP By-law exceeds these powers. For the reasons that follow, I cannot accept this argument.

[11] Part XXVII of the *Vancouver Charter* grants extensive powers to the City to determine how land within the city can be used. The three main powers are the power to zone land, the power to plan for land development and the power to issue development permits. (The latter power is of no concern here.) The power to zone land allows the City to establish permissible uses for particular zones, or areas of the City, and is exercised by passing zoning by-laws. The power to plan for development allows the City to set a vision and course for future development, and is exercised by preparing and revising “development plans” and by adopting by by-law development plans as ODPs. Zoning by-laws designate actual permitted uses, while ODPs are directed to preserving land for future non-actualized uses. Both, however, may have the effect of restricting how the designated land may be used. And in the case of both, the *Vancouver Charter* provides that the City is not liable to compensate landowners for loss as a result of these restrictions: s. 569.

[12] CPR makes a number of arguments to support its contention that the ODP By-law in this case was beyond the powers granted the City by the *Vancouver Charter*.

[13] CPR’s main argument is that the by-law exceeds the purpose of an ODP. That purpose, CPR suggests, is to set out policy for future land development. To the extent that the ODP goes further and affects land use, it must provide for the City’s acquisition of the land. This ODP, CPR says, is not “zoning” and has none of the protections associated with zoning. Nor is it “planning” because the effect on the landowner is binding. An ODP, in the submission of CPR, is simply a policy directive that has the effect of freezing development in order to prevent changes and improvements on the land while the City is engaged in the steps necessary to acquire the land. The contention is that the City misused the ODP power in this case since it never had any intention of purchasing the land and never took steps to do so. In short, CPR contends, to pass a valid ODP under ss. 561 and 562 of the *Vancouver Charter*, the City must have a plan to acquire the land. Since the City had no such plan, the ODP By-law is invalid.

[14] CPR buttresses this submission with the argument that the Legislature could not have intended the *Vancouver Charter* to permit the City to effectively expropriate land by use limitations without taking formal title. It points out that this is the first time in 40 years that the City has used its ODP power to effectively designate private land public without acquiring it. This, it says, is a new interpretation of the *Vancouver Charter* that the City has “dreamed up” to achieve its aim of using or freezing the corridor without legally acquiring it.

[15] CPR’s contention that the ODP By-law is invalid in the absence of a plan to acquire the land is not supported by the wording of the *Vancouver Charter*, which (1) confers a broad power on the City to pass ODPs for planning purposes without moving to implement those plans; and (2) specifically contemplates that ODPs may adversely affect land and exempts the City from liability for any such effects.

[16] First, the *Vancouver Charter* confers a broad power on the City to pass ODPs for planning purposes without requiring the City to implement those plans. The *Vancouver Charter *confers power on the City to plan for future development of “land”, “areas” and “sites”, which is precisely what the ODP By-law is intended to do: s. 561(2). An ODP is just what its name suggests — a plan to guide future development, not a fully actualized scheme. Thus, in defining “development plan”, s. 559 states that a plan for the future physical development of any part of the city does not need to be “complete”. It may be a “partial” plan. The steps necessary to bring the plan to fruition do not need to be worked out. This negates the suggestion that passing an ODP requires the City to acquire affected land.

[17] This is confirmed by s. 563(1) of the *Vancouver Charter*, which provides that “[t]he adoption by [City] Council of a development plan *shall not commit* the Council to undertake any of the developments shown on the plan” (emphasis added). More specifically, s. 564(1) states that “[w]here a project is shown upon an ODP, the Council *may* acquire any real property it considers essential to the carrying-out of the project” (emphasis added). In other words, the City may acquire property subject to the ODP, but is not obliged to acquire it.

[18] Second, the *Vancouver Charter* expressly contemplates the possibility that an ODP may adversely affect land and exempts the City from liability for such effects. This negates the argument that ODPs are simply statements of policy and, to the extent that they may affect land use and values, must be accompanied by plans to acquire the affected land. Section 569 deems that the exercise of the City’s power does not constitute a “tak[ing] or injuriou[s] affect[ion]” and that “no compensation shall be payable by the [c]ity or any inspector or official thereof”. The Legislature clearly contemplated that ODPs could have effects like those found in this case, and went on to hold that the City was not liable for the consequences.

[19] The effect of the ODP By-law in this case is to designate the Arbutus Corridor a public thoroughfare. The power to designate public thoroughfares was formerly a zoning power. In 1964, it was transferred to the ODP power. At the same time, s. 569 was expanded from protecting the exercise of zoning power to protecting the exercise of “any of the powers contained in this Part”: see *Vancouver Charter Amendment Act, 1964*, S.B.C. 1964, c. 72, ss. 17 and 19. This indicates that the Legislature contemplated that the exercise of the power to create a public thoroughfare under an ODP could adversely affect landowners, and deliberately dealt with that possibility by providing that the City would not be liable for such adverse affects. This is inconsistent with the argument that the Legislature intended the City to acquire any lands affected by an ODP.

[20] I conclude that the provisions of the *Vancouver Charter* do not require the City to either acquire or have a plan to acquire land that is subject to an ODP. The by-law is not invalidated on this ground.

[21] CPR also argues that the by-law is invalid because designation of the corridor for use only as a public thoroughfare effectively designates the corridor as a street. Section 2 of the *Vancouver Charter* defines “street” as including “any ... way normally open to the use of the public”. Section 289 of the *Vancouver Charter *requires a street to be vested in the City. CPR argues that this requires the City to obtain legal title to all land used for streets. Since it has not acquired title to the corridor, its designation for use as a public thoroughfare is invalid, CPR argues.

[22] I cannot accept this argument. Stipulating that a piece of land can be used only as a public thoroughfare in an ODP does not make it a street. It merely freezes the use of the land with a view to preserving it for future development by precluding present uses that might interfere with that development. In this case, for example, residential and commercial development cannot take place on the corridor because that might interfere with it being developed in the future for purposes of public passage. For the time being, however, the corridor remains private land in the hands of CPR. CPR’s argument rests on the premise that City Council must treat the corridor like a street, simply because the by-law allows use of the land for public passage. However, the City points out that the *Vancouver Charter*’s definition of “street” expressly excludes “a private right-of-way on private property”, which describes the corridor precisely.

[23] In a variation on this argument, CPR argues that the by-law purports to regulate motor vehicle traffic on the corridor, which can only be done on streets: s. 317. However, the by-law does not regulate traffic. It simply designates the corridor for use as a public thoroughfare that excludes motor vehicles. Motor vehicles are regulated only on street crossings, which are either vested in the City or for which the City holds an easement: s. 289.

[24] Finally, CPR argues that the by-law is invalid because its effect is not to designate land but to regulate it. Regulation, it argues, is not appropriate for an ODP. Again, there is no merit in this argument. The by-law does not regulate the use of land, but merely designates the corridor for use as a public thoroughfare. That designation makes applicable s. 563(3) of the *Vancouver Charter*, which limits the use that can be made of the corridor so designated. The limit arises from powers the Legislature gave to the City and the provisions of the *Vancouver Charter* enacted by the Legislature. Its effects cannot be said to be contrary to what the Legislature intended.

[25] I conclude that CPR’s contention that the by-law is invalid because it goes beyond the City’s powers under the *Vancouver Charter* cannot be accepted.

**3.2 Compensation**

[26] CPR argues there is a presumption that the Legislature intended any taking of property to be compensated. It argues that the ODP By-law, by limiting its use, constitutes an effective taking of its land. It cannot use the land for any economically viable purpose. It cannot, it says, even run a railway because the by-law precludes maintenance of its track. In these circumstances, the City has effectively “taken” its land and must compensate it, CPR urges.

[27] Like the Court of Appeal, I am not satisfied that the by-law prevents track maintenance or the operation of a railway on the corridor. Indeed, CPR has no desire to operate a railway there. Its real complaint is that the by-law prevents it from developing or using the corridor for economically profitable purposes. This amounts, it argues, to a *de facto* taking of its land, requiring compensation.

[28] CPR argues that at common law, a government act that deprives a landowner of all reasonable use of its land constitutes a *de facto* taking and imposes an obligation on the government to compensate the landowner.

[29] For a *de facto* taking requiring compensation at common law, two requirements must be met: (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property (see *Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General*) (1999), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696 (N.S. C.A.), at p. 716; *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R.* (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.); and *British Columbia v. Tener*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 (S.C.C.).

[30] In my view, neither requirement of this test is made out here.

[31] First, CPR has not succeeded in showing that the City has acquired a beneficial interest related to the land. To satisfy this branch of the test, it is not necessary to establish a forced transfer of property. Acquisition of beneficial interest related to the property suffices. Thus, in *Manitoba Fisheries*, the government was required to compensate a landowner for loss of good will. See also *Tener*.

[32] CPR argues that, by passing the ODP By-law, the City acquired a *de facto* park, relying on the observation of Southin J.A. that “the by-law in issue now can have no purpose but to enable the inhabitants to use the corridor for walking and cycling, which some do (trespassers all), without paying for that use” (para. 117). Southin J.A. went on to say: “The shareholders of ... CPR ought not to be expected to make a charitable gift to the inhabitants” (para. 118). Yet, as Southin J.A. acknowledged, those who now casually use the corridor are trespassers. The City has gained nothing more than some assurance that the land will be used or developed in accordance with its vision, without even precluding the historical or current use of the land. This is not the sort of benefit that can be construed as a “tak[ing]”.

[33] Second, the by-law does not remove all reasonable uses of the property. This requirement must be assessed “not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put”: see *Mariner Real Estate*, at p. 717. The by-law does not prevent CPR from using its land to operate a railway, the only use to which the land has ever been put during the history of the City. Nor, contrary to CPR’s contention, does the by-law prevent maintenance of the railway track. Section 559’s definition of “development” is modified by the words “unless the context otherwise requires”. Finally, the by-law does not preclude CPR from leasing the land for use in conformity with the by-law and from developing public/private partnerships. The by-law acknowledges the special nature of the land as the only such intact corridor existing in Vancouver, and expands upon the only use the land has known in recent history.

[34] CPR also argues that the British Columbia *Expropriation Act*, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 125, requires the City to compensate CPR (Appendix B). Section 1 of the Act defines “expropria[tion]” as “the taking of land by an expropriating authority under an enactment without the consent of the owner”, and goes on to define “expropriating authority” as “a person ... empowered under an enactment to expropriate land”. Section 2(1) of the Act provides that “[i]f an expropriating authority proposes to expropriate land, th[e] Act applies to the expropriation, and, if there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions of th[e] Act and any other enactment respecting the expropriation, the provisions of [the *Expropriation Act*] apply”. The *Expropriation Act* requires compensation for land expropriated, while the *Vancouver Charter* states the City is not obliged to compensate for adverse effects to land caused by an ODP. CPR argues that this constitutes an inconsistency and that, under s. 2 of the *Expropriation Act*, the requirement of compensation in that Act must prevail.

[35] This argument rests on the premise that there is an inconsistency between the *Expropriation Act* and the *Vancouver Charter* as applied to the facts in this case. It assumes that the land is “expropriate[d]” or “taken” and that the two statutes impose different obligations in this event - compensation in one case, no compensation in the other. In fact, however, the provisions of the *Vancouver Charter* prevent a conflict from ever arising. Section 569 of the *Vancouver Charter* provides that property affected by a by-law “shall be deemed as against the city not to have been taken”. The *Expropriation Act* applies only where there has been a “tak[ing]” or “expropriat[ion]”. Since by statute there is no taking or expropriation here, there is no inconsistency with the *Expropriation Act* and s. 2(1) cannot apply.

[36] I add this. Even if the facts of this case could be seen to support an inference of *de facto* taking at common law, that inference has been conclusively negated by s. 569 of the *Vancouver Charter*. The Province has the power to alter the common law. Here, by providing that the effects of the ODP By-law cannot amount to a “tak[ing]”, it has rendered inapplicable the common law *de facto* taking remedy upon which CPR relies.

[…]

**Conclusion**

[37] While one may sympathize with CPR’s position, none of its arguments withstand scrutiny. The City did not exceed the powers granted it by the *Vancouver Charter*. Neither the *Vancouver Charter* nor principles of common law require it to compensate CPR for the ODP By-law’s effects on its land. Finally, the City’s conduct in enacting the by-law complied with the requirements of fair process.

[38] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.

[39] *Appeal dismissed.*

## *Metalclad Corporation v The United Mexican States*, ICSID ARB(AF)/97/1 ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/metalclad.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/metalclad.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/metalclad.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

The Tribunal:—

**C. NAFTA, Article 1110: Expropriation**

[1] NAFTA Article 1110 provides that “[n]o party shall directly or indirectly … expropriate an investment … or take a measure tantamount to … expropriation … except: (a) for a public purpose; (b) on a non- discriminatory basis; (c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and (d) on payment of compensation …” “A measure” is defined in Article 201(1) as including “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice”.

[2] Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.

[3] By permitting or tolerating the conduct of Guadalcazar in relation to Metalclad which the Tribunal has already held amounts to unfair and inequitable treatment breaching Article 1105 and by thus participating or acquiescing in the denial to Metalclad of the right to operate the landfill, notwithstanding the fact that the project was fully approved and endorsed by the federal government, Mexico must be held to have taken a measure tantamount to expropriation in violation of NAFTA Article 1110(1).

[4] The Tribunal holds that the exclusive authority for siting and permitting a hazardous waste landfill resides with the Mexican federal government. This finding is consistent with the testimony of the Secretary of SEMARNAP and, as stated above, is consistent with the express language of the LGEEPA.

[5] As determined earlier (see above, para 92), the Municipality denied the local construction permit in part because of the Municipality’s perception of the adverse environmental effects of the hazardous waste landfill and the geological unsuitability of the landfill site. In so doing, the Municipality acted outside its authority. As stated above, the Municipality’s denial of the construction permit without any basis in the proposed physical construction or any defect in the site, and extended by its subsequent administrative and judicial actions regarding the *Convenio*, effectively and unlawfully prevented the Claimant’s operation of the landfill.

[6] These measures, taken together with the representations of the Mexican federal government, on which Metalclad relied, and the absence of a timely, orderly or substantive basis for the denial by the Municipality of the local construction permit, amount to an indirect expropriation.

[7] The present case resembles in a number of pertinent respects that of *Biloune, et al. v. Ghana Investment Centre, et al.*, 95 I.L.R.183, 207-10 (1993) (Judge Schwebel, President; Wallace and Leigh, Arbitrators). In that case, a private investor was renovating and expanding a resort restaurant in Ghana. As with Metalclad, the investor, basing itself on the representations of a government affiliated entity, began construction before applying for a building permit. As with Metalclad, a stop work order was issued after a substantial amount of work had been completed. The order was based on the absence of a building permit. An application was submitted, but although it was not expressly denied, a permit was never issued. The Tribunal found that an indirect expropriation had taken place because the totality of the circumstances had the effect of causing the irreparable cessation of work on the project. The Tribunal paid particular regard to the investor’s justified reliance on the government’s representations regarding the permit, the fact that government authorities knew of the construction for more than one year before issuing the stop work order, the fact that permits had not been required for other projects and the fact that no procedure was in place for dealing with building permit applications. Although the decision in Biloune does not bind this Tribunal, it is a persuasive authority and the Tribunal is in agreement with its analysis and its conclusion.

[8] Although not strictly necessary for its conclusion, the Tribunal also identifies as a further ground for a finding of expropriation the Ecological Decree issued by the Governor of SLP on September 20, 1997. This Decree covers an area of 188,758 hectares within the “Real de Guadalcazar” that includes the landfill site, and created therein an ecological preserve. This Decree had the effect of barring forever the operation of the landfill.

[9] The Tribunal is not persuaded by Mexico’s representation to the contrary. The Ninth Article, for instance, forbids any work inconsistent with the Ecological Decree’s management program. The management program is defined by the Fifth Article as one of diagnosing the ecological problems of the cacti reserve and of ensuring its ecological preservation. In addition, the Fourteenth Article of the Decree forbids any conduct that might involve the discharge of polluting agents on the reserve soil, subsoil, running water or water deposits and prohibits the undertaking of any potentially polluting activities. The Fifteenth Article of the Ecological Decree also forbids any activity requiring permits or licenses unless such activity is related to the exploration, extraction or utilization of natural resources.

[10] The Tribunal need not decide or consider the motivation or intent of the adoption of the Ecological Decree. Indeed, a finding of expropriation on the basis of the Ecological Decree is not essential to the Tribunal’s finding of a violation of NAFTA Article 1110. However, the Tribunal considers that the implementation of the Ecological Decree would, in and of itself, constitute an act tantamount to expropriation.

[11] In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Mexico has indirectly expropriated Metalclad’s investment without providing compensation to Metalclad for the expropriation. Mexico has violated Article 1110 of the NAFTA.

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

## Patent as Exclusion ##

{{< figure src="/media/monsanto_patent.jpg" caption="Monsanto Patent for glyphosate-resistant plants (US version)" >}}

A patent is effectively a statutory right—created and enforced under the federal *Patent Act*, RSC 1985, c P-4—to exclude others from the products of cultural, scientific and technological invention. Patents given their "owners" a time-limited, exclusive right to make, construct, use and sell the subject matter of the patent. 

The basic rationale behind patent rights is one about economic incentives. As an intangible good, the inventive idea or design that motivates a patent is by nature non-excludable: once the invention has been created and made public, it is essentially costless for others to reproduce that idea or design in order to make their own products. Because inventions often require considerable up-front and sometimes risky investments, the rationale goes, exclusive patent protections are needed in order provide creators with sufficient financial incentives to create in the first place. According to this argument, if the right to exclude via patent did not exists, creators would have no motivation to produce their intentions and society would suffer as a result. 

While a large body of recent research and thinking in the field of intellectual property law has explored other, non-financial reasons why creators produce a whole range of cultural and scientific products, the central economic rationale described above remains at the heart of modern patent law in Canada. 

Notice that this rationale for patent rights is heavily functionalist in character: patents exist—and are enforced by the courts—explicitly to structure and incentivize individual behaviour. As you read *Monsanto*, below, consider the role of this functionalist reasoning in the case. Does Chief Justice McLachlin also engage in formalist reasoning at any point in the judgement? Is it possible to reconcile these approaches in the course of the Court's decision?

**McLachlin CJC and Fish J:—**

**I. Introduction**

[1] This case concerns a large scale, commercial farming operation that grew canola containing a patented cell and gene without obtaining licence or permission. The main issue is whether it thereby breached the *Patent Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. We believe that it did.

[2] In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize from the outset that we are not concerned here with the innocent discovery by farmers of “blow-by” patented plants on their land or in their cultivated fields. Nor are we concerned with the scope of the respondents’ patent or the wisdom and social utility of the genetic modification of genes and cells — a practice authorized by Parliament under the *Patent Act* and its regulations.

[3] Our sole concern is with the application of established principles of patent law to the essentially undisputed facts of this case.

**II. The Salient Facts**

[4] Percy Schmeiser has farmed in Saskatchewan for more than 50 years. In 1996 he assigned his farming business to a corporation in which he and his wife are the sole shareholders and directors. He and his corporation grow wheat, peas, and a large amount of canola.

[5] In the 1990s, many farmers, including five farmers in Mr. Schmeiser’s area, switched to Roundup Ready Canola, a canola variety containing genetically modified genes and cells that have been patented by Monsanto. Canola containing the patented genes and cells is resistant to a herbicide, Roundup, which kills all other plants, making it easier to control weeds. This eliminates the need for tillage and other herbicides. It also avoids seeding delays to accommodate early weed spraying. Monsanto licenses farmers to use Roundup Ready Canola, at a cost of $15 per acre.

[6] Schmeiser never purchased Roundup Ready Canola nor did he obtain a licence to plant it. Yet, in 1998, tests revealed that 95 to 98 percent of his 1,000 acres of canola crop was made up of Roundup Ready plants. The origin of the plants is unclear. They may have been derived from Roundup Ready seed that blew onto or near Schmeiser’s land, and was then collected from plants that survived after Schmeiser sprayed Roundup herbicide around the power poles and in the ditches along the roadway bordering four of his fields. The fact that these plants survived the spraying indicated that they contained the patented gene and cell. The trial judge found that “none of the suggested sources [proposed by Schmeiser] could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality” ultimately present in Schmeiser’s crop (*Mosanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser* (2001), 202 F.T.R. 78 (Fed. T.D.), at para. 118).

[7] The issues on this appeal are whether Schmeiser infringed Monsanto’s patent, and if so, what remedies Monsanto may claim.

**III. Analysis**

***A. The Patent: Its Scope and Validity***

[8] 
Canola is a valuable crop grown in Canada and used to make edible oil and animal feed. The respondents are the licensee and owner, respectively, of Canadian Patent No. 1,313,830. This patent, titled “Glyphosate-Resistant Plants” was issued on February 23, 1993, and expires on February 23, 2010. It discloses the invention of genetically engineered genes and cells containing those genes which, when inserted into plants (in this case canola), dramatically increase their tolerance to herbicides containing glyphosate. Ordinarily, glyphosate inhibits an enzyme essential for plant survival. Most plants sprayed with a glyphosate herbicide do not survive, but a canola plant grown from seed containing the modified gene will survive.

[9] Since 1996, canola seed containing the patented gene and cell has been produced in Canada under licence from the respondents; this seed has been marketed to farmers under the trade name “Roundup Ready Canola”, reflecting its resistance to the glyphosate herbicide “Roundup” manufactured by the respondents. Roundup can be sprayed after the canola plants have emerged, killing all plants except the canola. This eliminates the need for tillage and other herbicides. It also avoids delaying seeding to accommodate early weed spraying.

[10] In 1996, approximately 600 Canadian farmers planted this Roundup Ready Canola on 50,000 acres. By 2000, approximately 20,000 farmers planted 4.5 to 5 million acres — nearly 40 percent of all canola grown in Canada.

[11] Monsanto requires a farmer who wishes to grow Roundup Ready Canola to enter into a licensing arrangement called a Technology Use Agreement (TUA). The licensed farmers must attend a Grower Enrollment Meeting at which Monsanto describes the technology and its licensing terms. By signing the TUA, the farmer becomes entitled to purchase Roundup Ready Canola from an authorized seed agent. They must, however, undertake to use the seed for planting a single crop and to sell that crop for consumption to a commercial purchaser authorized by Monsanto. The licensed farmers may not sell or give the seed to any third party, or save seed for replanting or inventory.

[12] The TUA gives Monsanto the right to inspect the fields of the contracting farmer and to take samples to verify compliance with the TUA. The farmer must also pay a licensing fee for each acre planted with Roundup Ready Canola. In 1998, the licensing fee was $15 per acre.

[13] A Roundup Ready Canola plant cannot be distinguished from other canola plants except by a chemical test that detects the presence of the Monsanto gene, or by spraying the plant with Roundup. A canola plant that survives being sprayed with Roundup is Roundup Ready Canola.

[14] The trial judge found the patent to be valid. He found that it did not offend the Plant Breeders’ *Rights Act*, S.C. 1990, c. 20, and held that the difficulty of distinguishing canola plants containing the patented gene and cell from those without it did not preclude patenting the gene. The trial judge also rejected the argument that the gene and cell are unpatentable because they can be replicated without human intervention or control.

[15] The scope of the patent is largely uncontroversial.

[16] The trial judge found that “it is the *gene* and *the process for its insertion* ... and *the cell derived from that process*” that comprise the invention (para. 88 (emphasis added), see also para. 26). The Federal Court of Appeal likewise endorsed the claims as being for “genes and cells which are glyphosate-resistant” (*Mosanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser* (2002), [2003] 2 F.C. 165 (Fed. C.A.), at para. 40).

[17] Everyone agrees that Monsanto did not claim protection for the genetically modified plant itself, but rather for the genes and the modified cells that make up the plant. Unlike our colleague, Arbour J., we do not believe this fact requires reading a proviso into the claims that would provide patent protection to the genes and cells only when in an isolated laboratory form.

[18] Purposive construction of patent claims requires that they be interpreted in light of the whole of the disclosure, including the specifications: *Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc.*, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067, 2000 SCC 67 (S.C.C.); *Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Sask.) Ltd.*, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504 (S.C.C.). In this case, the disclosure includes the following:

> **Abstract of Disclosure**
>
> Plant cells transformed using such genes and plants regenerated therefrom have been shown to exhibit a substantial degree of glyphosate resistance. (AR 235)
>
> **Background of the Invention**
>
> The object of this invention is to provide a method of genetically transforming plant cells which causes the cells and plants regenerated therefrom to become resistant to glyphosate and the herbicidal salts thereof. (AR 238)
>
> **Detailed Description of the Invention**
>
> Suitable plants for the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, soybean, cotton, alfalfa, canola, flax, tomato, sugar beet, sunflower, potato, tobacco, corn, wheat, rice and lettuce. (AR 240-241)

[19] A purposive construction therefore recognizes that the invention will be practised in plants regenerated from the patented cells, whether the plants are located inside or outside a laboratory. It is difficult to imagine a more likely or more evident purpose for patenting “a method of genetically transforming plant cells which causes *the cells and plants* regenerated therefrom to become resistant to glyphosate” (trial judgment, para. 20 (emphasis added)).

[20] More particularly, the patented claims are for:

1. A *chimeric gene*: this is a gene that does not exist in nature and is constructed from different species.

2. An *expression vector*: this is a DNA molecule into which another DNA segment has been integrated so as to be useful as a research tool.

3. A *plant transformation vector*: used to permanently insert a chimeric gene into a plant’s own DNA.

4. Various species of *plant cells* into which the chimeric gene has been inserted.

5. A *method of regenerating a glyphosate-resistant plant*. Once the cell is stimulated to grow into a plant, all of the differentiated cells in the plant will contain the chimeric gene, which will be passed on to offspring of the plant.

[21] The appellant Schmeiser argues that the subject matter claimed in the patent is unpatentable. While acknowledging that Monsanto claims protection only over a gene and a cell, Schmeiser contends that the result of extending such protection is to restrict use of a plant and a seed. This result, the argument goes, ought to render the subject matter unpatentable, following the reasoning of the majority of this Court in *Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45, 2002 SCC 76 (S.C.C.) (”*Harvard Mouse*”). In that case, plants and seeds were found to be unpatentable “higher life forms”.

[22] This case is different from *Harvard Mouse*, where the patent refused was for a mammal. The Patent Commissioner, moreover, had allowed other claims, which were not at issue before the Court in that case, notably a plasmid and a somatic cell culture. The claims at issue in this case, for a gene and a cell, are somewhat analogous, suggesting that to find a gene and a cell to be patentable is in fact consistent with both the majority and the minority holdings in *Harvard Mouse*.

[23] Further, all members of the Court in *Harvard Mouse* noted in *obiter* that a fertilized, genetically altered oncomouse egg would be patentable subject matter, regardless of its ultimate anticipated development into a mouse (at para. 3, *per* Binnie J. for the minority; at para. 162, *per* Bastarache J. for the majority.).

[24] Whether or not patent protection for the gene and the cell extends to activities involving the plant is not relevant to the patent’s validity. It relates only to the factual circumstances in which infringement will be found to have taken place, as we shall explain below. Monsanto’s patent has already been issued, and the onus is thus on Schmeiser to show that the Commissioner erred in allowing the patent: *Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd.*, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153, 2002 SCC 77 (S.C.C.), at paras. 42-44. He has failed to discharge that onus. We therefore conclude that the patent is valid.

***B. Did Schmeiser “Make” or “Construct” the Patented Gene and Cell, Thus Infringing the Patent?***

[25] The *Patent Act* confers on the patent owner “the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used”: s. 42. Monsanto argues that when Schmeiser planted and cultivated Roundup Ready Canola seed, he necessarily infringed their patent by making the gene or cell.

[26] We are not inclined to the view that Schmeiser “made” the cell within the meaning of s. 42 of the *Patent Act*. Neither Schmeiser nor his corporation created or constructed the gene, the expression vector, a plant transformation vector, or plant cells into which the chimeric gene has been inserted.

[27] It is unnecessary, however, to express a decided opinion on this point, since we have in any event concluded that Schmeiser infringed s. 42 by “using” the patented cell and gene.

***C. Did Schmeiser “Use” the Patented Gene or Cell, Thus Infringing the Patent?***

*(1) The Law on “Use”*

[28] 
The central question on this appeal is whether Schmeiser, by collecting, saving and planting seeds containing Monsanto’s patented gene and cell, “used” that gene and cell.

[29] The onus of proving infringement lies on the plaintiff, Monsanto.

[30] Infringement is generally a question of fact (see *Whirlpool, supra*). In most patent infringement cases, once the claim has been construed it is clear on the facts whether infringement has taken place: one need only compare the thing made or sold by the defendant with the claims as construed. Patent infringement cases that turn on “use” are more unusual. In those rare cases where a dispute arises on this issue, as in this case, judicial interpretation of the meaning of “use” in s. 42 of the Act may be required.

[31] Determining the meaning of “use” under s. 42 is essentially a matter of statutory construction. The starting point is the plain meaning of the word, in this case “use” or “*exploiter*”. *The Concise Oxford Dictionary* defines “use” as “cause to act or serve for a purpose; bring into service; avail oneself of”: *The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English* (9th ed.1995), at p. 1545. This denotes utilization for a purpose. The French word “*exploiter*” is even clearer. It denotes utilization with a view to production or advantage: “*tirer parti de* (*une chose*), *en vue d’une production ou dans un but lucratif*; [...] [*u*]*tiliser d’une manière advantageuse*...”: *Le Nouveau Petit Robert* (2003), at p. 1004.

[32] Three well-established rules or practices of statutory interpretation assist us further. First, the inquiry into the meaning of “use” under the *Patent Act* must be *purposive*, grounded in an understanding of the reasons for which patent protection is accorded. Second, the inquiry must be *contextual*, giving consideration to the other words of the provision. Finally, the inquiry must be attentive to the wisdom of the *case law*. We will discuss each of these aids to interpretation briefly, and then apply them to the facts of this case.

[33] We return first to the rule of purposive construction. Identifying whether there has been infringement by use, like construing the claim, must be approached by the route of purposive construction: *Free World Trust c. Électro Santé Inc.*, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024, 2000 SCC 66 (S.C.C.). “[P]urposive construction is capable of expanding or limiting a literal [textual claim]”: *Whirlpool, supra*, at para. 49. Similarly, it is capable of influencing what amounts to “use” in a given case.

[34] The purpose of s. 42 is to define the exclusive rights granted to the patent holder. These rights are the rights to full enjoyment of the monopoly granted by the patent. Therefore, what is prohibited is “any act that interferes with the full enjoyment of the monopoly granted to the patentee”: H. G. Fox, *The Canadian Law and Practice Relating to Letters Patent for Inventions* (4th ed. 1968), at p. 349; see also *Lishman v. Erom Roche Inc.* (1996), 68 C.P.R. (3d) 72 (Fed. T.D.), at p. 77.

[35] The guiding principle is that patent law ought to provide the inventor with “protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented”: *Free World Trust*, *supra* at para. 43. Applied to “use”, the question becomes: *did the defendant’s activity deprive the inventor in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of full enjoyment of the monopoly conferred by law*?

[36] A purposive approach is complemented by a contextual examination of s. 42 of the *Patent Act*, which shows that the patentee’s monopoly generally protects its business interests. Professor D. Vaver, in *Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-marks* (1997), suggests that the common thread among “(making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used)”... is that the activity is usually for commercial purposes — to make a profit or to further the actor’s business interests ...” (p. 151). This is particularly consistent with the French version of s. 42, which uses the word “*exploiter*”.

[37] As a practical matter, inventors are normally deprived of the fruits of their invention and the full enjoyment of their monopoly when another person, without licence or permission, uses the invention to further a business interest. Where the defendant’s impugned activities furthered its own commercial interests, we should therefore be particularly alert to the possibility that the defendant has committed an infringing use.

[38] With respect for the contrary view of Arbour J., this does not require inventors to describe in their specifications a commercial advantage or utility for their inventions. Even in the absence of commercial exploitation, the patent holder is entitled to protection. However, a defendant’s commercial activities involving the patented object will be particularly likely to constitute an infringing use. This is so because if there is a commercial benefit to be derived from the invention, a contextual analysis of s. 42 indicates that it belongs to the patent holder. The contextual analysis of the section thus complements — and confirms — the conclusion drawn from its purposive analysis. It is the reverse side of the same coin.

[39] We turn now to the case law, the third aid to interpretation. Here we derive guidance from what courts in the past have considered to be use. As we shall see, precedent confirms the approach proposed above and it is of assistance as well in resolving some of the more specific questions raised by this case.

[40] First, case law provides guidance as to whether patent protection extends to situations where the patented invention is contained within something else used by the defendant. This is relevant to the appellants’ submission that growing *plants* did not amount to “using” their patented *genes* and *cells*.

[41] Patent infringement actions often proceed in a manufacturing context. Case law has for that reason focussed on situations where a patented part or process plays a role in production. As Professor Vaver states, *supra*, at p. 152:

> ”Use” applies both to patented products and processes, and also to their output. A patent that covers a zipper-making machine or method extends to zippers made by the machine or method. Each zipper sold without authority infringes the patent, even if the zippers themselves are unpatented. This expansive doctrine applies, however, only if the patent plays an important part in production.

[42] By analogy, then, the law holds that a defendant infringes a patent when the defendant manufactures, seeks to use, or uses a patented part that is contained within something that is not patented, provided the patented part is significant or important. In the case at bar, the patented genes and cells are not merely a “part” of the plant; rather, the patented genes are present throughout the genetically modified plant and the patented cells compose its entire physical structure. In that sense, the cells are somewhat analogous to Lego blocks: if an infringing use were alleged in building a structure with patented Lego blocks, it would be no bar to a finding of infringement that only the blocks were patented and not the entire structure. If anything, the fact that the Lego structure could not exist independently of the patented blocks would strengthen the claim, underlining the significance of the patented invention to the whole product, object, or process.

[43] Infringement through use is thus possible even where the patented invention is part of, or composes, a broader unpatented structure or process. This is, as Professor Vaver states, an expansive rule. It is, however, firmly rooted in the principle that the main purpose of patent protection is to prevent others from depriving the inventor, even in part and even indirectly, of the monopoly that the law intends to be theirs: only the inventor is entitled, by virtue of the patent and as a matter of law, to the *full* enjoyment of the monopoly conferred.

[…]

[44] Moreoever, as Lord Dunedin emphasized in *British United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Simon Collier Ltd.* (1910), 27 R.P.C. 567 (U.K. H.L.), *possession as a stand-by has* “*insurance value*”, as for example in the case of a fire extinguisher. The extinguisher is “used” to provide the means for extinguishment should the need arise. This is true, too, of a spare steam engine which is “intended in certain circumstances to be used for exactly the purpose for which the whole machine is being actually used” (p. 572). Exploitation of the stand-by utility of an invention uses it to advantage.

[45] In *Terrell on the Law of Patents* (15th ed. 2000), at para. 8.24, the authors observe that “[t]he word ‘use’... would ... seem to indicate making practical use of the invention itself”. In some circumstances, “practical use” may arise from the stand-by utility resulting from mere possession of the invention, or from some other practical employment with a view to advantage. Use, and thereby infringement, are then established.

[…]

*(2) Application of the Law*

[46] The trial judge’s findings of fact are based, essentially, on the following uncontested history.

[47]  Mr. Schmeiser is a conventional, non-organic farmer. For years, he had a practice of saving and developing his own seed. The seed which is the subject of Monsanto’s complaint can be traced to a 370-acre field, called field number 1, on which Mr. Schmeiser grew canola in 1996. In 1996 five other canola growers in Mr. Schmeiser’s area planted Roundup Ready Canola.

[48] In the spring of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser planted the seeds saved on field number 1. The crop grew. He sprayed a three-acre patch near the road with Roundup and found that approximately 60 percent of the plants survived. This indicates that the plants contained Monsanto’s patented gene and cell.

[49] In the fall of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser harvested the Roundup Ready Canola from the three-acre patch he had sprayed with Roundup. He did not sell it. He instead kept it separate, and stored it over the winter in the back of a pick-up truck covered with a tarp.

[50] A Monsanto investigator took samples of canola from the public road allowances bordering on two of Mr. Schmeiser’s fields in 1997, all of which were confirmed to contain Roundup Ready Canola. In March 1998, Monsanto visited Mr. Schmeiser and put him on notice of its belief that he had grown Roundup Ready Canola without a licence. Mr. Schmeiser nevertheless took the harvest he had saved in the pick-up truck to a seed treatment plant and had it treated for use as seed. Once treated, it could be put to no other use. Mr. Schmeiser planted the treated seed in nine fields, covering approximately 1,000 acres in all.

[51] Numerous samples were taken, some under court order and some not, from the canola plants grown from this seed. Moreover, the seed treatment plant, unbeknownst to Mr. Schmeiser, kept some of the seed he had brought there for treatment in the spring of 1998, and turned it over to Monsanto. A series of independent tests by different experts confirmed that the canola Mr. Schmeiser planted and grew in 1998 was 95 to 98 percent Roundup resistant. Only a grow-out test by Mr. Schmeiser in his yard in 1999 and by Mr. Freisen on samples supplied by Mr. Schmeiser did not support this result.

[52]  Dr. Downey testified that the high rate of post-Roundup spraying survival in the 1997 samples was “consistent only with the presence in field number 2 of canola grown from commercial Roundup tolerant seed” (trial judgment, at para. 112). According to Dr. Dixon, responsible for the testing by Monsanto US at St. Louis, the “defendants’ samples contain[ed] the DNA sequences claimed in claims 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the patent and the plant cell claimed in claims 22, 23, 27, 28 and 45 of the patent”(trial judgment, at para. 113). As the trial judge noted, this opinion was uncontested.

[53] The remaining question was how such a pure concentration of Roundup Ready Canola came to grow on the appellants’ land in 1998. The trial judge rejected the suggestion that it was the product of seed blown or inadvertently carried onto the appellants’ land (at para. 118):

> It may be that some Roundup Ready seed was carried to Mr. Schmeiser’s field without his knowledge. Some such seed might have survived the winter to germinate in the spring of 1998. However, I am persuaded by evidence of Dr. Keith Downey ... that none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on Schmeiser’s crop.

[54] He concluded, at para. 120:

> I find that in 1998 Mr. Schmeiser planted canola seed saved from his 1997 crop in his field number 2 which he knew or ought to have known was Roundup tolerant, and that seed was the primary source for seeding and for the defendants’ crops in all nine fields of canola in 1998.

[55] In summary, it is clear on the findings of the trial judge that the appellants saved, planted, harvested and sold the crop from plants containing the gene and plant cell patented by Monsanto. The issue is whether this conduct amounted to “use” of Monsanto’s invention — the glyphosate-resistant gene and cell.

[56] The preliminary question is whether this conduct falls within the meaning of “use” or “*exploiter*”. We earlier concluded that these words, taken together, connote utilization with a view to production or advantage. Saving and planting seed, then harvesting and selling the resultant plants containing the patented cells and genes appears, on a common sense view, to constitute “utilization” of the patented material for production and advantage, within the meaning of s. 42.

[57] We turn next to whether the other considerations relevant to “use” support this preliminary conclusion.

[58] In this regard, the first and fundamental question is whether Monsanto was deprived in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of the full enjoyment of the monopoly that the patent confers. And the answer is “yes”.

[59] Monsanto’s patent gives it a monopoly over the patented gene and cell. The patent’s object is production of a plant which is resistant to Roundup herbicide. Monsanto’s monopoly enabled it to charge a licensing fee of $15 per acre to farmers wishing to grow canola plants with the patented genes and cells. The appellants cultivated 1030 acres of plants with these patented properties without paying Monsanto for the right to do so. By cultivating a plant containing the patented gene and composed of the patented cells without licence, the appellants thus deprived Monsanto of the full enjoyment of its monopoly.

[60] The complementary question is whether the appellants employed or possessed the patented invention in the context of their commercial or business interests. The initial answer must again be “yes”.

[61] One of the appellants’ businesses was growing canola. It used seeds containing the patented qualities in that business. Subject to the appellants’ argument discussed below that they did not use the patented invention itself (whether because they used only the plant or because they did not spray with Roundup), the appellants’ involvement with the disputed canola is clearly commercial in nature.

[62] The answers to the two questions of principle that lie at the heart of “use” under the *Patent Act* both thus suggest that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were correct in finding that the appellants “used” the protected invention and hence infringed Monsanto’s patent. It is helpful as well, however, to consider the insights gained from the case law discussed above and their impact on arguments raised against this conclusion.

[63] First, it is suggested that because Monsanto’s claims are for genes and cells rather than for plants, it follows that infringement by use will only occur where a defendant uses the genes or cells in their isolated, laboratory form. This argument appears not to have been advanced in any detail at trial or on appeal, but is the position taken by our colleague, Arbour J.

[64] It is uncontested that Monsanto’s patented claim is only for the gene and cell that it developed. This, however, is the beginning and not the end of the inquiry. The more difficult question — and the nub of this case — is whether, by cultivating plants *containing the cell and gene*, the appellants used the patented components of those plants. The position taken by Arbour J. assumes that this inquiry is redundant and that the only way a patent may be infringed is to use the patented invention in isolation.

[65] This position flies in the face of century-old patent law, which holds that where a defendant’s commercial or business activity involves a thing of which a patented part is a significant or important component, infringement is established. It is no defence to say that the thing actually used was not patented, but only one of its components.

[66] Professor Vaver, *supra*, observes that this is an “expansive doctrine”. This is so because otherwise the inventor would be deprived of the full enjoyment of the monopoly that the law of patent confers on him or her. It is rare that patented components or processes are used in isolation; without this principle, an infringer could use the invention to his advantage, and take shelter in the excuse that he or she was not using the invention in isolation.

[67]  Provided the patented invention is a significant aspect of the defendant’s activity, the defendant will be held to have “used” the invention and violated the patent. If Mr. Schmeiser’s activities with Roundup Ready Canola plants amounted to use interfering with Monsanto’s full enjoyment of their monopoly on the gene and cell, those activities infringed the patent. Infringement does not require use of the gene or cell in isolation.

[68] Second, Mr. Schmeiser argued at trial that he should not be held to have “used” Monsanto’s invention because he never took commercial advantage of the special utility that invention offered — resistance to Roundup herbicide. He testified that he never used Roundup herbicide as an aid to cultivation. (That he used it in 1996 in his initial gathering of the Roundup Ready seed is clear.)

[69] The trial judge dismissed this argument. He pointed out, at para. 122, that it “is the taking of the essence of the invention ... that constitutes infringement”, and that by growing and selling the Roundup Ready crop Mr. Schmeiser took that invention. Consequently, in the judge’s view, “whether or not that crop was sprayed with Roundup ... [was] not important” (para. 123).

[70] Perhaps the appellants’ failure to spray with Roundup herbicide is a way of attempting to rebut the presumption of use that flows from possession. However, the appellants have failed to rebut the presumption.

[71] Their argument fails to account for the stand-by or insurance utility of the properties of the patented genes and cells. Whether or not a farmer sprays with Roundup herbicide, cultivating canola containing the patented genes and cells provides stand-by utility. The farmer benefits from that advantage from the outset: if there is reason to spray in the future, the farmer may proceed to do so.

[72] Although not directly at issue in this case, cultivating Roundup Ready Canola also presents future revenue opportunities to “brown-bag” the product to other farmers unwilling to pay the licence fee, thus depriving Monsanto of the full enjoyment of their monopoly.

[73] Further, the appellants did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of use. It may well be that defendant farmers could rebut the presumption by showing that they never intended to cultivate plants containing the patented genes and cells. They might perhaps prove that the continued presence of the patented gene on their land was accidental and unwelcome, for example, by showing that they acted quickly to arrange for its removal, and that its concentration was consistent with that to be expected from unsolicited “blow-by” canola. Knowledge of infringement is never a necessary component of infringement. However, a defendant’s conduct on becoming aware of the presence of the patented invention may assist in rebutting the presumption of use arising from possession.

[74] However, the appellants in this case actively cultivated canola containing the patented invention as part of their business operations. Mr. Schmeiser complained that the original plants came onto his land without his intervention. However, he did not at all explain why he sprayed Roundup to isolate the Roundup Ready plants he found on his land; why he then harvested the plants and segregated the seeds, saved them, and kept them for seed; why he next planted them; and why, through this husbandry, he ended up with 1030 acres of Roundup Ready Canola which would otherwise have cost him $15,000. In these circumstances, the presumption of use flowing from possession stands unrebutted.

[75] Third, as in their submissions on validity, the appellants seek to rely on the decision of the majority of this Court in *Harvard Mouse*. They contend that the patent should be given a narrow scope for infringement purposes, since the plants reproduce through the laws of nature rather than through human intervention. Thus, they argue, propagation of Roundup Ready Canola without a licence cannot be a “use” by them because plants are living things that grow by themselves.

[76] This is also the perspective adopted by Arbour J. In support of the proposition that infringement of gene claims occurs only in a laboratory setting, she cites *Kirin Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd.*, [2002] E.W.J. No. 3792 (Eng. C.A.). That case dealt with a protein useful in the diagnosis and treatment of blood disorders. The English court construed the claims to exclude the naturally occurring form of the DNA sequence in a human cell. However, this was done to accord with the provisions of a regulatory scheme that has no parallel in Canada: Article 5 of the European Parliament’s Directive 98/44/EC, which regulates patentability of biotechnological inventions. It states that the discovery of elements of the human body, including genes, is not patentable, although such elements are patentable when isolated or otherwise produced through technical means. The legislature has not enacted a comparable statutory scheme in Canada to narrow the scope of patent construction. Thus, *Kirin Amgen* is not applicable to the case before this Court.

[77] The appellants’ argument also ignores the role human beings play in agricultural propagation. Farming is a commercial enterprise in which farmers sow and cultivate the plants which prove most efficient and profitable. Plant science has been with us since long before Mendel. Human beings since time immemorial have striven to produce more efficient plants. Huge investments of energy and money have been poured into the quest for better seeds and better plants. One way in which that investment is protected is through the *Patent Act* giving investors a monopoly when they create a novel and useful invention in the realm of plant science, such as genetically modified genes and cells.

[78] Finally, many inventions make use of natural processes in order to work. For example, many valid patents have referred to various yeasts, which would have no practical utility at all without “natural forces”. See *Abitibi Co., Re* (1982), 62 C.P.R. (2d) 81 (Can. Pat. App. Bd. & Pat. Commr.), in which the inventive step consisted of acclimatizing a known species of yeast from domestic sewage to a new environment, where it would then through its natural operation act to purify waste from pulp plants.

[79] The issue is not the perhaps adventitious arrival of Roundup Ready on Mr. Schmeiser’s land in 1998. What is at stake in this case is *sowing* and *cultivation*, which necessarily involves deliberate and careful activity on the part of the farmer. The appellants suggest that when a farmer such as Mr. Schmeiser actively cultivates a crop with particular properties through activities such as testing, isolating, treating, and planting the desired seed and tending the crops until harvest, the result is a crop which has merely “grown itself”. Such a suggestion denies the realities of modern agriculture.

[80] Inventions in the field of agriculture may give rise to concerns not raised in other fields — moral concerns about whether it is right to manipulate genes in order to obtain better weed control or higher yields. It is open to Parliament to consider these concerns and amend the Patent Act should it find them persuasive.

[81] Our task, however, is to interpret and apply the *Patent Act* as it stands, in accordance with settled principles. Under the present Act, an invention in the domain of agriculture is as deserving of protection as an invention in the domain of mechanical science. Where Parliament has not seen fit to distinguish between inventions concerning plants and other inventions, neither should the courts.

[82]  Invoking the concepts of implied licence and waiver, the appellants argue that this Court should grant an exemption from infringement to “innocent bystanders”. The simple answer to this contention is that on the facts found by the trial judge, Mr. Schmeiser was not an innocent bystander; rather, he actively cultivated Roundup Ready Canola. Had he been a mere “innocent bystander”, he could have refuted the presumption of use arising from his possession of the patented gene and cell. More broadly, to the extent this submission rests on policy arguments about the particular dangers of biotechnology inventions, these, as discussed, find no support in the *Patent Act* as it stands today. Again, if Parliament wishes to respond legislatively to biotechnology inventions concerning plants, it is free to do so. Thus far it has not chosen to do so.

[83] The appellants argue, finally, that Monsanto’s activities tread on the ancient common law property rights of farmers to keep that which comes onto their land. Just as a farmer owns the progeny of a “stray bull” which wanders onto his land, so Mr. Schmeiser argues he owns the progeny of the Roundup Ready Canola that came onto his field. However, the issue is not property rights, but patent protection. Ownership is no defence to a breach of the *Patent Act*.

[84] We conclude that the trial judge and Court of Appeal were correct in concluding that the appellants “used” Monsanto’s patented gene and cell and hence infringed the *Patent Act*.

[…]

**IV. Conclusion**

[85] We would allow the appeal in part, setting aside the award for account of profit. In all other respects we would confirm the order of the trial judge. In view of this mixed result, we would order that each party bear its own costs throughout.

## Patents in Hollywood

The film PERCY, released in 2020 and starring Christopher Walken, dramatized the events behind *Monstanto v Schmeiser*. The trailer below is worth watching for its attempt to capture the broader social and political significance of the case during the time it was making its way through the courts.
