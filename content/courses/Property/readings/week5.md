As we saw in Week 4, the act of physical control—as a crucial element of showing legal possession—is given special priority by the common law. In the case of "unowned" things, like the wild seals we studied in *[Clift v Kane,](../week4/#clift-v-kane-1870-5-nfld-lr-nfld-en-banc)* showing physical control (plus an intention to control) amounts not only to legal possession for a period of time but also to absolute ownership—at least, if the animal can no longer "escape". Exactly *how* one can show sufficient physical control is, as we saw, often difficult to define. 

Now we turn our attention to possession of land. Recall that, according to Locke, his theory of first possession by labour applies equally to personal and real property (i.e., to things and land). We will see some important implications of this and other ideas in Locke next week when we begin to look at Indigenous land rights. This week, our focus will be on the relationship between *possession* and *title*—two related but distinct common law concepts. The title holder is often referred to as the "true" or "absolute" owner of the land, and they continue to hold title even when someone else is in possession of the land (with or without the owner's permission). At the same time, someone in possession of land may enjoy certain property rights that are enforceable against other non-possessors. From the perspective of classical liberalism, possession arises from the dynamics of free competition between individuals, while title is a means to limit and stabilize that competition by granting possession the *imprimatur* of the state.

### A key distinction

From the common law's perspective, "legal title" and "legal possession" are distinct concepts. One might hold title without being in possession, or one might be in possession without title. Sometimes, possession can serve as the basis for (or "ripen" into) title, and in exceptional cases a possessor can displace the holder of legal title altogether.

## Land Title and Possession in African Nova Scotian Communities ##

This week, we will explore a contemporary case study of possession and title to understand how these concepts were developed in the classical legal style and the continuing influence of that way of thinking. In several African Nova Scotian communities today, individuals and their communities live with the consequences of unclear legal title to their lands. These circumstances "stem from a history fraught with racism, oppression and inequity"[^cameron2014]. As Justice Campbell observes at paragraphs 4-5 in *[Downey v Nova Scotia,](#downey-v-nova-scotia-attorney-general-2020-nssc-201)* below:

> African Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.

> That has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations […]

Some of the history behind Black Nova Scotians' unclear land title is outlined in *[Beals v Nova Scotia,](#beals-v-nova-scotia-attorney-general-2020-nssc-60)* below. Addressing this history and its current consequences helps us to understand how the interplay of possession and title to land matters. For African Nova Scotians who continue to be denied title to their lands, state demands for individuals to "prove" their possession have become both a tool of systemic racism and a means to deflect state responsibility for a long history of discrimination.

Start by reading the included excerpts from the *Land Titles Clarification Act* and from *Beals v Nova Scotia* for background to this case study. We will then examine the following questions:

> What rights does the common law afford to those in possession of land (but without title)?

> What is *adverse possession* and how does this doctrine foreground the classic liberal dynamics of competition in disputes over land? 

Finally, we will return to some recent litigation in *Downey v Nova Scotia* concerning land titles in African Nova Scotian communities to examine the impact of common law doctrines around title and possession.

[This case addresses the interpretation of the *Land Titles Clarification Act*, successor legislation to the *Community Land Titles Clarification Act*, which was enacted in 1964 to address the problem of unclear land titles in Black Nova Scotian communities. We will not address the specific facts in *Beals*, but read the case to understand some of the relevant historical background.]

*Bodurtha J. —*

**The *LTCA* [*Land Titles Clarification Act*] - Historical background**

[1] The *Community Land Titles Clarification Act*, the predecessor to the *LTCA*, was assented to on March 18, 1964. On second reading of the proposed legislation, the Honourable W. S. Kennedy Jones stated:

> The purpose of this legislation is to provide a simpler and less expensive machinery for the clarification of titles within areas or communities.

> The second section of the Act is the definition section, and therein the minister is defined as being the Minister of Lands and Forests, and I perhaps should point out that my particular interest in the preparation and presentation of the present legislation is as the chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights.

> The third section of the bill provides that the Governor-in-Council may define an area for consideration under the Act, if there is a lack of development which can be traced to confusion or obscurity in titles.
It further provides that the designation must be approved by the municipal authorities.

> The fourth section of the Act sets forward the procedure to be followed by the minister, and under certain circumstances by a commissioner appointed under the Act.

> The final section of the Act makes provision for any party who feels he has suffered because of the operation of the Act to make application to the Governor-in-Council for adjustment.

> This act will be of particular use in communities such as New Roads within the county of Halifax, and it has, of course, general application in many areas throughout the province.

> [Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Hansard, 48th Gen. Ass. (4 March 1964) at 887-888 (Hon. W. S. Kennedy Jones)]

These brief comments are the only contemporaneous information available as to the purpose of the legislation.

[2] The current *Land Titles Clarification Act* contains many of the same provisions as the *Community Land Titles Clarification Act*. It is clear from Hansard that the Act was intended to provide a simpler and less expensive means for clarifying title in areas where “there is a lack of development which can be traced to confusion or obscurity in titles”. What is unclear from the debates, however, is how these areas came to exist. The only hint is in the comment by the Honourable W.S. Kennedy Jones that his interest in the legislation was as chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights (the predecessor to the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission). The applicant attempted to fill in this information gap by including excerpts from various secondary sources in his brief. These sources include: (1) a Masters of Arts thesis submitted to Dalhousie University in 2006 by Erica Colter entitled *A State of Affairs Most Uncommon: Black Nova Scotians and the Stanfield Government’s Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, 1959-1967*; (2) an article by Lindsay Van Dyk entitled *Shaping a Community, Black Refugees in Nova Scotia*, available on the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 website; (3) a report prepared for the United Nations Human Rights Council by the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent setting out its findings following a visit to Canada in October 2016; and, (4) a report prepared by then Schulich School of Law student Angela Simmonds entitled *This Land is Our Land: African Nova Scotian Voices from the Preston Area Speak Up* (August 19, 2014). These sources discuss the experiences of black migrants who settled in Nova Scotia in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the continued impact of those experiences on subsequent generations of African Nova Scotians. Some also address how the *LTCA* has been implemented since its enactment. The respondent takes the position that these materials should not be considered by the court because they were not before the decision maker, nor were they the subject of a successful motion to admit fresh evidence. At the same time, however, counsel for the respondent conceded during argument that “it would be important for the Minister to be aware and understand the circumstances with respect to individuals living in these land clarification areas, certainly”.

[3] It is helpful to examine the contested sources more closely. In her Masters thesis, Ms. Colter explains that black settlers arrived in Nova Scotia in three main groups — the Loyalists (1783-1785), the Maroons (1796), and the refugees of the War of 1812 (1813-1815). These settlers arrived in Nova Scotia under the pretence of offers of generous land grants from the British government. Unlike their white counterparts who typically received at least 100 acres of fertile land, black families were given ten-acre lots of poor-quality land. That land was segregated from the lands given to white families. In addition, while white settlers were given deeds to their land, black settlers were given “tickets of location” and “licenses of occupation”. Without legal title to their land, black settlers could not sell or mortgage their property, or legally pass it down to their descendants upon their death. Although a limited number of land titles were eventually issued in Preston, and some settlers were able to purchase land, most black families never attained clear title to their land. Lack of clear title and the segregated nature of their land triggered a cycle of poverty for African Nova Scotian families that persisted for generations: 

> If blacks had attained legal ownership of their land, this would have afforded them a substantially helpful financial asset. Without this asset, blacks held little collateral and therefore had great difficulty making financial advancements; while many whites turned their land grants into successful agricultural holdings and pursued other business interests, blacks struggled to survive. Such financial hardships supported a cycle of poverty that soon included a failing or non-existent education system. Blacks seeking an education through secular schools were challenged by the Nova Scotia School Act of 1811 which virtually denied access of education to poor communities. The Act stated that the government would only fund a school after the community built a schoolhouse, hired a teacher, and raised a requisite amount of money. If these conditions were not first in place, the government would not provide the community with funds for the building costs or provide further, ongoing support for the school. Most black communities were too poor to initiate such arrangements and therefore the members of the community could not access an education through this manner. An educated black community might have broken or eased this cycle of poverty, but unfortunately, most black regions could not end the cycle under these circumstances. Until 1954, issues of legal school segregation and discrimination persisted in Nova Scotia; certain black regions went years without schools as qualified teachers were not available or were not willing to accept the small salaries offered.

> [Colter, Erica. *A State of Affairs Most Uncommon: Black Nova Scotians and the Stanfield Government’s Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, 1959-1967* (Master of Arts, Dalhousie University, 2006), at pp. 19-20]

[4] The isolated nature of rural black communities was accompanied by a lack of community development. Ms. Colter writes at p. 23:

> Life for black Nova Scotians by the 1960s, therefore, was still difficult, and blacks continued to face challenges similar to those faced by the early Loyalists, Maroons, and Refugees. The mid twentieth century marked a turning point in black history, however, as black problems began to gain wider attention. Urban communities, such as Africville, had long been recognized as a dire problem, but black communities in Nova Scotia’s rural areas began to share Africville’s notoriety.

> Life was worse for rural blacks as their isolation had led them to be forgotten by urban dwellers and government officials. Blacks in both urban and rural areas tended to live closely together, but the urban-living blacks frequently lived in areas also inhabited by whites. Black communities in rural areas were usually segregated and remote, and this isolation often was accompanied by an absence of typical community developments such as water, sewage, sanitation, garbage removal, road improvements, and other related services regularly provided in white or mixed communities. When blacks first arrived in the eighteenth century, the public’s initial response of benevolence and financial assistance was short-lived. This attention waned, and black communities remained forgotten until the improved communication systems and better roads of the 1950s and 1960s, both initiatives of Stanfield’s government, uncovered the state of these remote communities and public interest and concern returned. Stanfield recognized that, contrary to the long-held belief that black poverty was a black problem, “their problems have been exposed, and even more important, are recognized as problems of the whole community.” (citing Gwendolyn Shand, *Adult Education Among the Negroes of Nova Scotia* (Halifax: Institute of Public Affairs, Dalhousie University, 1961) at p. 3.)


[5] In 1962, Premier Robert Stanfield created the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights (ICHR). It was charged with giving immediate attention to housing, education and employment issues faced by African Nova Scotians. Ms. Colter reviewed the minutes of ICHR meetings as part of her research. In relation to land titles, she notes at p. 98:

> In the 1960s, blacks were encountering discrimination and confusion over land titles. Many blacks were without documentation proving ownership of their land, even though the land had stayed within a family for generations. Clear titles would have helped blacks who were in the midst of relocation and improvement projects; as well, proof of land ownership would have increased a black family’s livelihood. Without a clear title, a family would be unable to sell or lease the land, or even to use the property as collateral to secure credit.

> Stanfield’s government recognized this concern, and one of the ICHR’s noteworthy accomplishments was its creation of the *Community Land Titles Act* on 18 March 1964. This Act was intended to facilitate the process by which Nova Scotians could apply to clear their land titles. ...

[6] The article by Lindsay Van Dyk that is published on the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 website contains similar historical information as the Colter thesis. The author describes the migration of people of African descent to Nova Scotia, starting in the late 1700s. In relation to land grants, she writes:

> Upon their arrival in Nova Scotia, the Black Refugees experienced many hardships. The government withheld land grants, an influx of white immigration increased competition for the few jobs available, and the rocky, infertile land proved difficult to cultivate. Under these conditions, extreme poverty became a reality for many Black Refugees. ...

> The Black Refugees settled in the rural areas around Halifax, with the largest communities established at Preston, Hammonds Plains and Beechville. *Initially, the settlers were “well pleased and satisfied” at the prospect of having land to call their own. However, the government did not give the Black Refugees outright grants to the land, but rather tickets of location or licenses of occupation. This denied the Black Refugees the opportunity to own land or sell it for a profit. The lots provided by the government were limited to ten acres and located on rocky, infertile soil.* In these conditions, crops planted by the Black Refugees repeatedly failed. A series of devastating natural events made efforts to cultivate the land even more difficult. In 1815, entire fields were destroyed by hordes of mice that swept across Nova Scotia’s countryside. The following year became known as the “Year without a Summer,” as the ground stayed frozen until June and ten inches of snow fell that same month. Even when the Black Refugees did achieve some success in producing crops, the long, cold winter seasons generally depleted their resources. Many Black Refugees were forced to rely on government assistance and private charity despite their best efforts to become independent.

> The white population of Nova Scotia resented the dependence of the Black Refugees and did not accept them as equal members of society. Provincial authorities protested that the Refugees were “unfitted by nature to this climate, or to an association with the rest of His Majesty’s Colonists.” The general poverty of the Black Refugees was regarded as proof that the black population was more suited to slavery than freedom. ...

> [Emphasis added]

[7] The Report of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent on its mission to Canada contains the following references to land titles in Nova Scotia:

> 60. The Working Group is concerned about the lack of implementation of the Land Titles Clarification Act in Nova Scotia, which should assist people of African descent in obtaining titles to the lands on which they live. The Act was passed in Nova Scotia in 1963 to create a process to assist with the clarification of land title and land ownership issues for residents living in 13 specific communities in Nova Scotia. For historic and systemic reasons, there was a lack of land ownership documentation for the residents of those areas and communities, many of whom are African Nova Scotian. The Act was intended to provide a simpler and inexpensive mechanism to obtain clarification of land titles. Under the Act, a certificate of title is issued to applicants who can show that they used and occupied the land claimed for at least 20 years. The process provides for notice to be given to the community and issues such as competing ownership claims and unsettled boundaries to be resolved before a certificate can be issued.

> 61. Civil society informed the Working Group that the system in place under the Act was not working as hoped. The process is reportedly unjust and discriminatory, and many have had their claims rejected. Residents must bear the burden for submitting all the documentation, as well as the application, lawyer and surveyor fees necessary to have the land title clarified. In May 2015, the Department of Natural Resources, which is responsible for processing the applications, acknowledged that the process was unclear and stated they were attempting to pilot a project to assist residents in the community to obtain the title to their property. It was recognized that there were financial and logistical hurdles for some residents wishing to obtain a certificate of title, as residents were responsible for all the costs of the process, include [sic] surveying and legal fees. However, an interdepartmental committee was currently considering various options for removing or reducing those barriers and providing support to African Nova Scotians to help them clarify titles to their properties. The Working Group emphasized that the Act must be implemented in collaboration with, and for the benefit of, the affected population group. All resources should be made available, fees should be waived and remedies should be provided for any discriminatory policies relating to the process of granting a certificate of title.

[8] The final source is *This Land is Our Land: African Nova Scotian Voices from the Preston Area Speak Up*, a report prepared by then Schulich School of Law student Angela Simmonds. Ms. Simmonds explains at p. 3 that the report contains the results from a series of interviews she conducted during the months of June, July and August 2014, with “African Nova Scotian community members who are well-informed of African Nova Scotian historical land ownership”. Interviews focused on three topics:

1. What are the historical challenges and barriers faced by African Nova Scotian people when dealing with land ownership;

2. In what ways has the Land Titles Clarification Act been used in the process to acquire title to land from government; and

3. In what ways can we move forward to address future land ownership, acquisition and community education around the process of land ownership.

[9] The report contains some of the same historical information on the migration of black families to Nova Scotia discussed in the other sources, obtained by the author from the Nova Scotia Archives website. Unlike the other sources, however, the report contains firsthand accounts from African Nova Scotians of their negative experiences dealing with government and the LTCA. The only portion of the report relied on by the applicant in his brief relates to the reason that some community members do not believe in writing wills:

> During this process of interviewing members in the community I inquired about the lack of wills for some community members. Community members explained that elders in the community affiliate death with wills. To many in the community, wills represent death and with such strong religious beliefs and faith it is not something that is discussed in the home.

> Culturally it is known that the land would go to the youngest child of the family or the child who was residing in the home when the parents pass away. Without a will this becomes difficult and can result in conflict.

## Rights of Possessors ##

With this background in mind, we now turn to some of the central common law doctrines around possession to land. The next case, *Asher v Whitlock*, examines the question of what happens when two claimants—neither of whom hold title—make competing claims to land. In the course of answering that question, the Court elaborates on the rights of parties in possession. Because of the style in which some mid-nineteenth century law reports were written—presenting the lawyers at trial in dialogue with the judges, followed by the court's final judgement—*Asher* provides an opportunity to reconnect the arguments bites we studied in Unit 1 to the role of the classical common law style in "resolving" competing argument pairs. 

## Asher v Whitlock (1865), LR 1 QB 1 ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Asher.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Asher.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/Asher.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

At the trial before Cockburn, C.J., at the last Bedfordshire Spring Assizes, the following facts appeared in evidence. About Michaelmas, in the year 1842, Thomas Williamson inclosed from the waste of a manor a piece of land by the side of the highway; and in 1850, he inclosed more land adjoining, and built a cottage; the whole being the land as described and claimed in the writ. He occupied the whole till his death in 1860. By his will he devised the whole property, describing it as "a cottage and garden, in Keysoe Row, in which I now dwell," to his wife Lucy Williamson, for and during so much only of her natural life as she might remain his widow and unmarried; and from and after her decease, or second marriage, whichever event might first happen, to his only child Mary Ann Williamson, in fee. After the death of Thomas Williamson, his widow remained in possession with the daughter, and in April, 1861, married the defendant; and from that time they all three resided on the property till the death of the daughter, aged eighteen years, in February, 1863. On her death, the defendant and his wife, the widow of the testator, continued to reside on the premises; the widow died in May, 1863, and the defendant still continued to occupy.

The female plaintiff is the heir-at-law of the testator's daughter Mary Ann Williamson. The writ was issued 11th of April, 1865.

These facts being undisputed, the Chief Justice directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the whole of the property claimed; with leave to move to enter the verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the testator had no devisable interest in any part of the property.

A rule nisi was afterwards obtained to enter the verdict for the defendant, on the ground that no title in the plaintiffs was shewn to either portion of the land enclosed.

{{< spoiler text="Structure of the Law Reports" >}}To this point, the law reporter excerpted here has described the undisputed facts as they were presented to the Court at trial. Next, the lawyers' arguments before the Court are summarized. First, the plaintiff's lawyer Markby sets out their position. Merewether, the defendant's lawyer, then attempts to respond. In square brackets, you can see summaries of the judges' comments in dialogue with Merewether.

This back-and-forth between the lawyer and the judges is very much an active example of the structure of common law arguments/counter-arguments we studied in Unit 1. Try to identify as many argument types as you can in these exchanges.{{< /spoiler >}}

Markby (Nov. 2nd), shewed cause. The testator, at the time of his death, had acquired no title by lapse of time; and the point made and reserved at the trial was, that the testator being only a trespasser in possession, had no devisable interest; that his interest was at most that of a tenant at will only; and that the devisee, if in possession, was only a new trespasser. But the authorities are conclusive to shew that a person in peaceable 3possession of land has, as against every one but the true owner, an interest capable of being inherited, devised, or conveyed. In *Doe v. Jauncey*, which was also the case of an inclosure from the roadside, a somewhat similar objection was taken; but Coleridge, J., said: "The moment the father had taken the land, if he died, it would (provided the owner did not interfere) descend to his son." In *Doe v. Barnard*, a distinction is clearly drawn by the court between persons who succeed each other in possession, claiming one from the other by descent, devise, or conveyance, and persons who succeed each other in possession, there being no such relation between them. The same doctrine is recognised in Doe v. Birchmore. Moreover, in this case, the plaintiff was not bound to shew any title at all as against the defendant. The defendant must be taken on the facts to have entered by the daughter's permission, whose title, therefore, he cannot dispute, So neither can he dispute the title of the female plaintiff, the daughter's heir-at-law. Doe v. Birchmore[3] is a direct authority on this point. There the defendant had come in as the servant of the testator, who was himself only tenant at will; and in ejectment brought by the devisee against the defendant, who remained in possession after the death of the testator, the court held that the defendant, the servant, could not compel the devisee to prove that the testator had title; and that it was sufficient to shew that the defendant came in under the testator.

Merewether (Nov. 2nd and 3rd), in support of the rule. As to the point last made, the defendant did not come in under the plaintiff's title, that is under the will, but adversely to it; for at the very moment of the marriage, the estate of the widow ceased; and the defendant entered as a wrong-doer.

[COCKBURN, C.J. The widow had rightful possession, which became wrongful on her marriage; but she had the same actual possession. She, therefore, coming in under the will, cannot dispute title claimed under it, and by means of the marriage her possession became that of the defendant; if she cannot dispute the validity of the will, neither can he.]

When the defendant entered, the wife being already married had ceased to hold under the will.

[MELLOR, J. The defendant's contention is, that the woman being a free agent, could throw up her estate, and that the defendant, coming in after the marriage, came in as a wrong-doer. COCKBURN, C.J. The widow, after her second marriage, would not be a wrong-doer in the sense of a trespasser.]

The defendant cannot be said to come in under the will, for he entered and took possession in spite of the will.

[COCKBURN, C.J. Why are we to assume his possession was in spite of the will? He goes into the cottage, and lives with the mother and daughter, who claim under the will.]

Secondly, assuming the defendant's possession to be adverse to the will, the case is that of two trespassers, and in such a case, the one last in possession is entitled to keep the land until the person having title ejects him; and the devise of the first confers no title on his devisee, so as to enable her or her heir to maintain ejectment against the present possessor.

[COCKBURN, C.J. Under the old law, a disseisor had good title against all but the disseisee; and if the disseisor died before entry by the disseisee, the latter's entry was tolled, and he was driven to his real action.]

This is not the case of a disseisor. In *Doe v. Barnard*, a prior possession being shewn, the plaintiff, who had only a title from mere possession for less than twenty years, was held incapable of maintaining her action of ejectment. In such a case, any one getting possession, without force or fraud, can maintain his possession. In *Dixon v. Gayfere*, where there had been several successive and independent occupiers, all without title, and the possession ultimately came to the court, the Master of the Rolls decreed possession to the last occupier, expressly on the ground that at law he could have maintained his possession against all but the true owner, who in that case was barred by lapse of time.

[COCKBURN, C.J. The Master of the Rolls may be right in equity, but I doubt his being right in law. In *Doe v. Dyeball*, Lord Tenterden held, that possession for one year by the plaintiff was sufficient, to maintain ejectment against a person who came and turned him out, without any further proof of title.]

In that case the possession of the defendant was obtained by force. Here it was simply adverse.

COCKBURN, C.J. —

I am of opinion that this rule should be discharged. The defendant, on the facts, is in this dilemma; either his possession was adverse, or it was not. If it was not adverse to the devisee of the person who inclosed the land, and it may be treated as a continuance of the possession which the widow had and ought to have given up, on her marriage with the defendant, then, as she and the defendant came in under the will, both would be estopped from denying the title of the devisee and her heir-at-law. But assuming the defendant's possession to have been adverse, we have then to consider how far it operated to destroy the right of the devisee and her heir-at-law. Mr. Merewether was obliged to contend that possession acquired, as this was, against a rightful owner, would not be sufficient to keep out every other person but the rightful owner. But I take it as clearly established, that possession is good against all the world except the person who can shew a good title; and it would be mischievous to change this established doctrine. In Doe v. Dyeball one year's possession by the plaintiff was held good against a person who came and turned him out; and there are other authorities to the same effect. Suppose the person who originally inclosed the land had been expelled by the defendant, or the defendant had obtained possession without force, by simply walking in at the open door in the absence of the then possessor, and were to say to him, “You have no more title than I have, my possession is as good as yours,” surely ejectment could have been maintained by the original possessor against the defendant. All the old law on the doctrine of disseisin was founded on the principle that the disseisor's title was good against all but the disseisee. It is too clear to admit of doubt, that if the 6devisor had been turned out of possession he could have maintained ejectment. What is the position of the devisee? There can be no doubt that a man has a right to devise that estate, which the law gives him against all the world but the true owner. Here the widow was a prior devisee, but durante viduitate only, and as soon as the testator died, the estate became vested in the widow; and immediately on the widow's marriage the daughter had a right to possession; the defendant however anticipates her, and with the widow takes possession. But just as he had no right to interfere with the testator, so he had no right against the daughter, and had she lived she could have brought ejectment; although she died without asserting her right, the same right belongs to her heir. Therefore I think the action can be maintained, inasmuch as the defendant had not acquired any title by length of possession. The devisor might have brought ejectment, his right of possession being passed by will to his daughter, she could have maintained ejectment, and so therefore can her heir, the female plaintiff. We know to what extent encroachments on waste lands have taken place; and if the lord has acquiesced and does not interfere, can it be at the mere will of any stranger to disturb the person in possession? I do not know what equity may say to the rights of different claimants who have come in at different times without title; but at law, I think the right of the original possessor is clear. On the simple ground that possession is good title against all but the true owner, I think the plaintiffs entitled to succeed, and that the rule should be discharged.

MELLOR, J. —

I am of the same opinion. It is necessary to distinguish between the case of the true owner and that of a person having no title. The fact of possession is *prima facie* evidence of seisin in fee. The law gives credit to possession unless explained; and Mr. Merewether, in order to succeed, ought to have gone on and shewn the testator's title to be bad, as that he was only tenant at will, but this he did not do. In *Doe v. Dyeball* possession for a year only was held sufficient against a person having no title. In *Doe v. Barnard* the plaintiff did not rely on her own possession merely, but shewed a prior possession in her husband, with whom she was unconnected in point of title. Here the first 7possessor is connected in title with the plaintiffs; for there can be no doubt that the testator's interest was devisable. In the common case of proving a claim to landed estate under a will, proof of the will and of possession or receipt of rents by the testator is always *prima facie* sufficient, without going on to shew possession for more than twenty years. I agree with the Lord Chief Justice in the importance of maintaining, that possession is good against all but the rightful owner.

LUSH, J., concurred.

Rule discharged.

### Parking Chairs

It was undisputed in *Asher* that Thomas Williamson had come into possession of the land at issue by "inclosing" it—presumably, by building a fence or erecting some other sort of boundary marker (as well as constructing a cottage on it). Erecting a fence is a quintessential  way of marking something as "mine", and generally sends a clear message to others to "keep out". What other practices do we understand as signalling possession? Are these practices always meant to be recognized in the eyes of the law, or do they have other audiences? 

For example, in some cities in the United States—famously, Chicago—it is common practice for residents who dig out public street parking spaces after a snow storm to place a chair in the spot while their car is away. This practice (calling "dibs") is widely understood to mark the spot as "theirs", at least for the time being. It is not, however, an uncontested practice. Calling dibs on a parking spot or violating the norm it represents has been known to lead to heated arguments between neighbours andm in some cases, outright violence.

## Adverse Possession ##

Adverse possession is an unusual common law doctrine. We have already emphasized the point that legal possession and legal title are distinctive concepts. In general, a "mere possessor" cannot disturb the legal title of the landowner, but the doctrine of adverse possession creates a dramatic exception. Under this doctrine, when a person has been in possession of land for longer than a period established by statute (called the *limitation period*), they may become the title holder—and the original title holder may end up with nothing. The ultimate effect of adverse possession is to take title out of the hands of the original owner and to put that title into the hands of the person in possession.

Adverse possession claims are not easily won. There is a laundry list of legal requirements that an adverse possessor needs to meet—in addition to possession beyond the limitation period—which we will examine later in the course. Our purpose in introducing adverse possession here is to explore how the doctrine and its underlying rationales came to be interpreted in classical legal thought. From this perspective, adverse possession was fundamentally about competition between the title holder and the adverse possessor—competition that was generally resolved based on whether the court regarded the adverse possessor as a productive member of society putting land to good use or, alternatively, as a duplicitous trespasser seeking to take unfair advantage of the law.

**Halliburton, C. J.**

[1] It appeared at the trial that the land in dispute was included in a grant which was made to Jonathan Belcher in 1773, which the lessees of the plaintiff claim by several mesne conveyances.

[2] The case therefore rests upon the defendant's claim under the statutes of Limitation.

[3] It appears that in the year 1784 a grant passed to William Sutherland, and several other grantees bounded to the south upon the north line of the Belcher grant; but it is quite clear that instead of the south line of Sutherland's grant, having been laid out upon the ground on the north line of the Belcher grant, it was placed upwards of a mile to the south of it, and that possession according to that line has been held by those claiming under Sutherland's grant for more than double the number of years requisite to give a title under the statute. This was indeed so far admitted at the argument that the plaintiffs did not claim to dispossess the defendant of that part of the land which he had actually cultivated and occupied, but as he had defended for a portion of it which was still in a wilderness state, they contended that they were entitled to a verdict for that. The defendant, however, contends that as the deeds under which he claims, contain the uncultivated as well as the cultivated land, and he or those under whom he claims have held by those deeds for upwards of 50 years that he is entitled to retain both.

[4] It has long been recognized as law that when a man without colour of title, claims to hold land under the statute against him who shows title that he shall only retain what he has actually occupied for 20 years.

[5] But the defendant maintains that when the original entry was under colour of title and possession, and was taken by metes and bounds, 20 years actual occupation of part gives the virtual possession of the whole so as to establish a title under the statute, and reference was made to several cases decided in the United States in support of this position.

[6] The situation of lands in this Province resembles that of those in the United States so much more than of those old and long cultivated lands in the mother country, that we may frequently consider with advantage the view which their courts have taken of questions of this nature. And on turning to their reports and elementary writers, I find that although they sustain the position of one who enters and holds for 20 years under color of title they have guarded it with so many reasonable exceptions that there is little danger of injuring the rightful owner in cases of conflicting constructive possession. It would occupy too much time to cite the cases at length upon this subject, they are fully detailed and ably commented upon in Angel on Limitations (Chap. 31). See also the observations of Story, J., in *Prescott et al., vs. Nevers*, [4 Mason, 430.]

[7] Our natural sense of justice points out a strong distinction between a lawless intruder who enters upon the land of another without any pretence to claim it as his own, and one who deems he has a right to enter, but is not clothed with a strictly legal title. There can be little doubt that the object of the Legislature in passing the Statute of Limitations was rather to shield those who held under defective titles than to protect mere wrongdoers; although their object could not effectually be maintained without barring all investigation into the legal title where the owner had allowed an adverse possession to be held against him for 20 years, and thus sheltering both.

[8] If ever there was a defendant who might most conscientiously claim the protection of the statute, it is the defendant in this case. The grant to Belcher passed in 1773: after his death the title vested in the Kirbys, in 1779, who took possession of the southern portion of the land by their agent, and commenced improvements upon it, but although they were in the constructive possession of the whole tract of five thousand acres or more, no act of ownership was ever exercised by them or their agents upon the northern part of the tract, although they held the land until the year 1813, when the conveyance was made to Murphy. In 1784 long prior to this, the grant called the soldiers grant had passed to Sutherland and others, bounded southerly upon the north line of the Belcher's grant. The passing of a grant of so large a tract of land, 12,250 acres, to a numerous body of recently disbanded soldiers must have been a matter of great notoriety in the settlement, and yet there does not appear to have been any opposition given by those interested in the Belcher grant to laying out the soldiers grant by a line far to the south of that now claimed as the north line of the Belcher grant. In this state things appear to have remained until the sale to Murphy in 1813, forty years after the Belcher grant passed and I think it well worthy of remark that the plan annexed to the conveyance to Murphy indicates an acquiescence in the south line which had been run for the soldiers grant. For in the deed to Murphy there is a reservation of town lots without any other description of their position than a reference to the plan, and on that plan we find them laid down very near the north line, while the north line now claimed is nearly two miles to the southward of them. There is no proof of any attempt having been made to run the line 480 chains north from the shore, until after the sale to Murphy, nor has anything further been done than running out the lines according to the description in the grant, although the defendant and several others claiming under the soldiers grant were then living within those lines. Watt, himself, so far recognized a line of the soldiers grant farther south than that now claimed, that subsequent to the running of this north line he expressed his surprise, "said it was not his land, that it was the soldiers grant, and he did not claim the land there."

[9] While all this is permitted by the lessees of the plaintiff, and those under whom they claim, let us see what is actually done by those under whom the defendant claims. William Sutherland, one of the grantees in the soldiers grant, it appears, drew No. 4, the lot now occupied by defendant, and on the 4th Oct., 1792, he conveyed it with all the buildings and improvements thereon, by very particularly described metes and bounds, to John Peitzsh, as a lot containing 650 acres. This deed was recorded 4th July, 1798. On the 21st April, 1798, John Peitzsh conveyed the same lots by the same metes and bounds to Hugh McDonald, the grandfather of the defendant. This deed was recorded Sept. 25th, l798. Hugh McDonald resided on the land, cultivated and improved it, and from him it has descended to the defendant. At what precise time William Sutherland, the grantee, took possession of this lot in severalty, does not appear, but it was evidently before 1792, when he conveyed it with a dwelling house, cow house, etc, to Peitzsh. Nearly 60 years ago then the grantee sold it and it has since passed from purchaser to purchaser. It has descended from grandson to grandson, and has been held adversely to the lessors of the plaintiff and those under whom they claim, ever since Sutherland, the grantee, first took possession of it.

[10] Although the possession was originally taken erroneously there is no reason even to surmise that the error was intentional, no one who has been long conversant with the proceedings in this court will be surprised at it: grants, particularly those conveying large tracts of land, were seldom, if ever, laid out with any approach to accuracy, and though the mistake was a great one, and that south line of the soldiers grant, if established, would deprive the claimants of the Belcher grant of 2,000 acres of land; yet it was not greater than that originally committed by the officer of the Crown, who, with the intention of granting, 5,000 acres of land, described it by metes and bounds, which according to the testimony of Kent, included upwards of 8,000; such mistakes were of frequent occurrence, sometimes operating against the grantees, but more frequently in their favor.

[11] But without adverting to motives with which we have little to do, it is clear that in point of view, a grantee under the soldiers grant took possession upwards of 60 years ago of a lot of land as part of that grant which it now clearly appears had been granted to Belcher. That he conveyed it by metes and bounds to Peitzsh in 1792, that Peitzsh conveyed it to McDonald in 1798 by the same metes and bounds, and from McDonald it has descended to his grandson, the defendant, who has long occupied it and exercised the usual acts of ownership over property of that nature, and therefore without laying down any inflexible rule as to adverse possession taken by metes and bounds under color of title, I think that under the circumstances of this case, the defendant is well entitled to hold all that his grandfather bought; and therefore that the rule to set aside this verdict should be discharged.

Campbell J., —

[1] This is a judicial review of a decision made by the Department of Lands and Forestry with respect to Christopher Downey’s claim under the *Land Titles Clarification Act* R.S.N.S., c. 250. In 2017 Mr. Downey applied for certificate of claim to land on which he had lived in North Preston since 2001. The Department denied the claim because the 20-year time period required by the Department to establish ownership based on adverse possession had not been met. Mr. Downey says that the legislation does not contain any requirement that adverse possession be established in order to have a certificate of claim issued. He asserts that because the Department imposed a requirement that was not set out in the legislation, the decision was unreasonable and should be set aside.

**Summary**

[2] The policy requirement that an applicant establish adverse possession of property for a period of 20 years to show apparent entitlement in order to have an application for a certificate of claim under the *Land Titles Clarification Act* considered, is not mandated by the act. The policy is not consistent with the purpose of the legislation. The Minister’s decision is set aside, and the matter is remitted for reconsideration. Adverse possession for 20 years may be a factor to assist in determining apparent entitlement but the absence of proof of adverse possession is not a barrier to having an application considered.

**The *Land Titles Clarification Act***

[3] On November 24, 2017 Mr. Downey filed an application for land titles clarification under the *Land Titles Clarification Act* with respect to a property at 39 Beals Crescent in North Preston. The history, context and purpose of that legislation has been reviewed in detail by my colleague Justice Bodurtha in *Beals v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)*, 2020 NSSC 60 (N.S. S.C.).

[4] African Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.

[5] That has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations. That is because in those communities, informal arrangements were more common. Financial and other obstacles made it less likely that people in those communities would retain lawyers and surveyors to research title, register deeds or wills, or to survey boundaries. People may have lived on land for generations without having title registered. No one else might claim it and it may be that no one in the community disputes their entitlement to it. But they still have no formal title.

[6] The legislation under which Mr. Downey made his application was intended to provide people who live in designated areas with a simpler and less expensive way to clarify title to their property. North Preston is one of those designated areas.

[7] Under the legislation a person who resides in Nova Scotia and claims to own land in one of the designated areas can make an application for a certificate of claim. That application must contain a description of the land so that it can be identified and distinguished from other land. The application must include a concise statement of the facts on which the person bases the claim for ownership, and it must name other people who have occupied the land or who have claimed ownership or an interest in the land. That application must be accompanied by an abstract of title, a statutory declaration attesting to the history of the occupation of the land and a statement showing the names of anyone who holds any form of charge on the land, like a mortgage or judgment. It could be described as an alternative to the more cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming process of the *Quieting Titles Act* R.S.N.S., c. 382. One of the issues here is just how much more expedited that process should be in order to achieve the purposes of the legislation.

[8] Section 4(4) of the *Land Titles Clarification Act* provides that the Minister of Lands and Forestry may require the applicant to provide any information that the Minister desires and may require the applicant to verify any material or information accompanying the application. That provides the Minister with considerable discretion in terms of the information that may be required.

[9] The certificate of claim is the first step toward obtaining a certificate of title. Section 5(1) says that when it appears from the application that the “applicant is entitled to the lot of land” the Minister may issue a certificate of claim. If the Minister cannot determine whether the applicant is entitled to the land the matter is referred to a commissioner to examine the claim. That commissioner, who is a barrister appointed by the Minister, recommends issuance of a certificate or provides reasons for not making the recommendation. When the commissioner recommends issuing a certificate of claim, the Minister may issue one without making further inquiries.

[10] Once a certificate of claim is issued the Minister is required to register it. The public is notified through publication in a newspaper. The certificate of claim then places an onus on those who also claim an interest in the land. Holders of liens, mortgages and judgments affecting the land, which have been in place for more than 2 years and on which no payments or written acknowledgments have been made for two years or more are required to take steps to enforce the security. Once notice has been provided, they have 3 months to enforce it. If steps are not taken the lien or charge on the property, it is deemed to no longer be binding on the land. Others, who claim an interest in the land can file a notice with the Minister within 60 days of the certificate of claim having been filed. That person then has 60 more days within which to start an action in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the interest they claim is valid. If that action has not been started the Minister will grant a certificate of title to the applicant.

[11] So, the certificate of claim starts a process by which other interested parties are then required to take some action to either enforce the registered charge on the property if they have one, or make a formal claim for a declaration of an interest in the land. If no claims are made within the time limits set out in the act, the Minister is required to grant the certificate of title. The applicant then has title to the land in fee simple.

[12] The issuing of a certificate of claim is then more than an acknowledgement that a claim has been made. It grants that claim status as a presumptive interest in the land which others are then required to contest.

[13] The Minster “may” issue a certificate of claim, when it appears that the applicant is “entitled to the lot of land”. The Minister then has to make a determination of whether the applicant appears to be “entitled”. The legislation does not set out the grounds upon which the Minister can make that determination and does not provide any definition of entitlement. What does it mean to be “entitled” to land, within the context of this remedial legislation?

**The Application**

[14] In Mr. Downey’s case, he filed an application with respect to a small portion of another larger parcel of land. The property was confirmed to be within one of the designated areas to which the *Land Titles Clarification Act* applies. No certificate of title had been issued previously for that property. Mr. Downey’s lawyer filed an abstract of title, a statutory declaration and a statement listing the encumbrances on the property.

[15] Mr. Downey’s statutory declaration set out the history of the property. He and his wife had built a home there between the summer of 2001 and October 2002. They had lived in the house continuously since then.

[16] His great grandfather Peter Beals and his wife, Heidi, had settled on the larger parcel ten-acre lot that included the property at 39 Beals Crescent. That was in 1913. That larger parcel was passed on to their daughter, Mr. Downey’s grandmother, Lena. Lena and her husband, James Downey Sr. built a new house there. Lena (Beals) and James Downey Sr. got a certificate of title under the predecessor legislation the *Community Land Titles Clarification Act* in 1970. That house lot is now owned by Wesley Kay Downey and Mary Jo-Ann Neish. That larger property has road access and 39 Beals Crescent could only have road access if a right of way were granted by the owners of that larger parcel. Mr. Downey now gets access to the road over that property.

[17] The smaller parcel of property claimed by Christopher Downey and on which his house has been built, was at one time claimed by his uncle, Texas Downey and his wife Jennifer Downey. They have relinquished that claim and have given the land to Christopher Downey and his wife, Christselina.

[18] From the time the house was built in 2001/2002 Mr. Downey says that no one has disputed his claim to ownership. He added a front deck to the house in 2011 and paved and extended the driveway. He built a back deck and a fence in 2016. He has tried to pay property taxes but because he was not the assessed owner of the land he could not. Mr. Downey says that other people in the community know that he and his wife have lived on the land and they consider it to belong to them.

[19] Pastor Wallace Smith was born in North Preston in 1941 and has lived there almost all of his life. He knows the area and the people who live in it. He confirmed Mr. Downey’s history of the property.

[20] When Mr. Downey’s claim was considered, the Senior Land Administration Officer in the Department of Lands and Forestry informed Mr. Downey’s lawyer that the 20-year limitation period to establish ownership based on adverse possession had not been met.

**The Issue**

[21] The issue is whether the denial of the certificate of claim based on a requirement of 20 years of adverse possession was unreasonable.

[22] **The Standard of Review**

[23] Reasonableness is now the presumptive standard of review in all cases. *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65 (S.C.C.), at para. 10.

[24] In *Vavilov*  the Supreme Court of Canada said that there are two ways in which an administrative decision can be found to have been unreasonable. The first is if there has been a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process. The second is if the decision is untenable in light of relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it. The issue here is whether the interpretation of the *Land Titles Clarification Act* by the Department of Lands and Forestry in Mr. Downey’s case is untenable in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints.

[25] The approach to review based on the reasonableness standard is intended to take into account the various kinds of administrative decisions that are subject to review. What is reasonable in a given situation depends on constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of that particular decision. “These contextual constraints dictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt.” *Vavilov*, at para. 90.

[26] The court provided examples of the “constraints”. They include the governing statutory scheme and the principles of statutory interpretation, relevant statutory or common law, past practices and decisions of the Department, and the potential impact of the decision on the individual to whom it applies.

[27] **Legislative Constraints**

[28] The governing statute is always a constraint on administrative decision makers. The Department of Lands and Forestry must operate within the constraints imposed by the *Land Titles Clarification Act*.

[29] Section 4 of the act sets out the information that is required for a person to apply for a certificate of claim. That document is required before a person can get a certificate of title. It is a first step. The section deals with the quality of the information that must be provided by a person making a claim. It does not require that a claimant establish a period of 20 years of adverse possession or provide information that would allow the Department to assess whether the property had been occupied for 20 years. It contains no reference at all to adverse possession or facts that would establish a claim of adverse possession. It does require that the applicant provide a history of the occupation of the land. That history then must have some bearing on the apparent entitlement of the applicant to the land that is the subject of the application.

[30] Section 5 requires the Minister to determine whether it appears as though the applicant is entitled to the lot. The legislation is silent on the basis upon which entitlement is established. There are no regulations. The legislation does not specifically require a period of possession for 20 years, but it may be presumed that entitlement must be based on some objective criteria in order for that issue to be assessed.

[31] The Minister cannot fetter their discretion by applying a standard that is not set out in the legislation. In *Chaffey v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador*, 2020 NLSC 56 (N.L. S.C.), the Minister of Justice had refused to issue a licence under the *Exhumation Act* because the applicant had not established the consent of the deceased’s next of kin. That criterion was found in the application form for the licence, but it was not contained in the legislation. The court found that a statutory decision maker with wide discretionary authority cannot fetter that discretion by imposing one or more conditions that must be met before the authority can be exercised. The court said that administrative decision makers who treat policies as if they were law and consider themselves bound by them are fettering their discretion and making an unreasonable decision.

[32] Justice Noel in that case answered the question that this proposition inevitably raises. Decision makers have to be able to rely on some factors, otherwise their decisions are open to being criticized as being arbitrary. How do they consider those factors without fettering their discretion? Justice Noel noted that the legislation did not contain any direction as to how the Minister’s discretion should be exercised. A policy that required the Minister to take into consideration the presence or absence of consent would be justifiable. But to say that no consideration would be given to a request in the absence of consent would be an abdication of the statutory responsibility to consider all circumstances. Any absence of consent is one factor in the consideration of all the circumstances for or against the grant of a licence.

[33] Applying that reasoning to this case, having 20 years of adverse possession would be a factor that could be considered when assessing entitlement. It is not set out in the legislation as a condition precedent to having an application considered and it should not be treated, in effect, as one. The Minister is required to assess whether it appears as though the applicant is entitled to the land. Possession over a period of time can be good evidence of such an entitlement but if it is treated as a requirement it is no longer a form of proof but a hurdle.

[34] Possession itself may be proof of entitlement but requiring adverse possession would be inconsistent with the purposes of the *Land Titles Clarification Act*. Adverse possession must be open, notorious, adverse, exclusive, peaceful, actual, and continuous. The holder of legal title can be displaced by a trespasser whose possession of land is unchallenged for a set time. That time is usually set out by statute. In Nova Scotia it is set out in the *Real Property Limitations Act*. Section 10 of that act prevents actions from being taken for recovery of land beyond 20 years from the date on which the action could first have been taken. The *Land Titles Clarification Act* and the *Real Property Limitations Act* do not reference each other. The *Land Titles Clarification Act* deals with addressing historical wrongs, by simplifying the process by which people can obtain title to land. The 20-year time limitation set out in the *Real Property Limitations Act* has nothing to do with that process.

[35] Adverse possession is a concept that acts to prevent a person from being displaced by the legal title owner of the land. The person in possession is necessarily not the holder of that legal title, otherwise the possession would not be adverse. The *Land Titles Clarification Act* is intended to clarify title to land of which the applicant claims to be the real owner.

[36] Adverse possession is an impractical test in the context of the remedial nature of the legislation. A person like Mr. Downey who was permitted by a relative to build a house on a piece of land could not claim that he occupied the land in a way that would be adverse to the interests of his relative or to those of some unknown holder of the legal title. In Mr. Downey’s case, no one has ever disputed his, or his family’s ownership, or occupation of the land.

[37] Adverse possession deals with a situation in which the legal title is clear but is inconsistent with the facts of long-term occupation on the ground. The *Land Titles Clarification Act* is intended to deal with the situation in communities in which the legal title is for various historical reasons, unclear.

[39] One of the constraints that should be considered as bearing upon the decision is the past decisions made by the administrative body. Adverse possession was a test for entitlement has been used by the Department of Lands and Forestry likely since 2015. The test is set out in the application materials and in various presentations made to public and stakeholder groups. Justice Bodurtha acknowledged the test in *Beals* but that was not an issue that he was required to decide in that case. Inconsistency of application can render a decision unreasonable. Consistent application of an unreasonable standard cannot make it reasonable. A test cannot be deemed reasonable simply because an administrative decision maker has consistently applied a factor that was not mandated by the legislation as a condition precedent.

[40] **Impact of the Decision**

[41] The impact of the decision on the applicant is a consideration. In this case, Mr. Downey is seeking to have clarification of title to the land that he says he has occupied for close to 20 years. As Justice Bodurtha noted in *Beals*, the lack of clear title and the segregated nature of their land triggered a cycle of poverty for black families that persisted for generations. The *Land Titles Clarification Act* was intended to help in redressing that historical wrong. By requiring Mr. Downey to prove adverse possession for 20 years or more, he is left with his house built on land to which he does not have clear title.

[42] If he waited for just another year, he would meet the 20-year standard. While that may be true, it is not entirely clear that he would meet the test of adverse possession, because it is not clear against whom he would be claiming that right.

[43] **Conclusion**

[44] The decision to not grant a certificate of claim because adverse possession has not been established was unreasonable and the decision is set aside.

[45] As noted in *Vavilov* when a decision reviewed by applying the reasonableness standard cannot be upheld, it is most often appropriate to remit the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration. The decision maker may arrive at the same, or a different conclusion.

[46] Mr. Downey’s application is remitted to the Minister for reconsideration, without the requirement that he prove 20 years of adverse possession. The length of time during which he has openly occupied the land may be a factor for consideration but adverse possession for 20 years is not a condition precedent to assessment of his claim.

[47] Mr. Downey has not claimed costs in this matter.

[48] *Application granted.*
