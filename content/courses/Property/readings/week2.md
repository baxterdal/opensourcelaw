<!--from v1 Week 1 -->

## Reading Our First Case 

The first case we’ll read in this course — the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in *Harrison v Carswell* — is about a labour dispute at a shopping mall in Winnipeg in the mid-1970s. That setting may not strike you as obviously important or exciting, but *Harrison* is arguably one of the Supreme Court's most important decisions for what it reveals about the central problems and debates in property law, and — more important still — for what it shows us about *how* judges and lawyers engage in those debates using the patterns and practices of common law legal argument.

There are several layers here that we will peel away in order to fully appreciate *Harrison*. We will undertake this project one step at a time, and I will ask you to read the case more than once — from a few different perspectives — over the next two weeks. 

Before you jump into the case as a whole, watch the short screencast below to start building a few essential strategies for reading *Harrison* and other complex cases in our course.

### Exercise: Quick Case Review

A simple strategy for quickly reviewing a case:

1. Read the facts closely.

2. Skip ahead to find out where each judge lands in their final decision.

3. Work through the case text in detail, paragraph by paragraph, stopping at after each main point or issue to reflect on what you've learned.

Once you've completed the quiz above, move on to step 3 of the case review strategy: read the full case as closely as possible. You will likely find some terms and concepts a little confusing; others you might find totally incomprehensible. This is completely normal. Try not to get too discouraged if you find that reading cases is frustrating at first. Keep going — this will get easier as you practice, even if it feels like treading water for now. I encourage you to take the case in chunks, using the prompts along the way to pause your reading and take stock of what you're learning or finding it hard to understand.

## Why Are We Reading *Harrison*? ##

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is compelling because the issues and arguments seem to transcend those facts, speaking to much bigger questions about law and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 

Next week, when we return to *Harrison v Carswell* for a second reading of the case, I will try to convince you that this question of who has the better or more persuasive arguments is not really an important question — or at least, it is not the *most* important question about *Harrison* — at this stage of your legal education. Rather than focusing on whether one or the other set of reasons are good or bad from a legal (or any other) standpoint, I will ask you to focus on the question of *how* the legal reasoning in *Harrison* actually works in practice. 

Here is another way of posing this challenge for you to think about before Week 2. In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.

At the end of Week 1, I asked you to consider *similarities* in the judges' arguments in *Harrison v Carswell*, rather than focus only on their disagreements. This week, we delve into those similarities in order to see how the deeper patterns of common law argument structure and constrain the way judges and other legal actors think, write and speak.

### Key point

Common law arguments are highly patterned, and the structure of those arguments — though not necessarily the outcome of arguing — is fairly predictable. These patterns of argument recur again and again in the cases we will read this year. Becoming proficient in common law arguments means being able to recognize and make use of these patterns.
{{% /callout %}}

The patterns I am talking about here occur at two different levels. At one level are the specific forms of argument and counter-argument we commonly see in courtroom settings and judicial decisions. For example, one party argues:

> Plaintiff has a right to do X (such as, exclude other people from their property).

The other party responds:

> True, but these facts justify a limitation on plaintiff's right to do X in the circumstances.

There may be many possible argument pairs like this based on any set of facts, but because they are patterned we should be able to situate them in more general categories.

At another level are the broader historical currents in legal thought that determine which forms of argument and counter-argument are more likely to be seen as persuasive in context at any given time.

A good way to think about all this is to draw an analogy to language.[^stein2018] Learning to speak a new language requires you to learn a whole new set of words that make up the language—i.e., its *vocabulary*. But to actually learn the language, you need to learn not only its vocabulary but also its *grammatical structure*—i.e., how the words fit together to form coherent thoughts expressed in that language. 

The recurring forms of legal argument and counter-argument we will study — what we'll call "argument types" — are the basic units of common law vocabulary. This week and next, we will develop a preliminary list or lexicon of these argument types and learn how to use them to analyze and make legal arguments in the common law tradition.

Next, in Unit 2, we will start to uncover the deeper "grammatical" structure of common law property by studying how changing ideas about the market and the state influence and constrain the legal vocabulary of judges and lawyers during different historical eras. But for now, you can set to one side this idea of legal grammar and focus on the new vocabulary you need to learn first.

## Invalid Arguments ##

Earlier, I noted that the four arguments types we've used so far are not exhaustive — there are no doubt other types we could identify and use to classify common law reasoning. Or perhaps there is a different set of argument types altogether that better describes the patterns that interest us. The point is that such patterns exist and, as we spend more and more time learning and using common law arguments, we come to understand (or intuit) that what counts as a legitimate or "valid" legal argument must fit into one or another well-recognized categories.

Which must mean that sometimes an argument will not fit into a well-recognized category, and therefore might be seen as "invalid" or illegitimate in the context of common law reasoning. Such arguments fall outside the normal vocabulary of the common law.

### Spotting an Invalid Argument

Of course, identifying an argument as "invalid" according to the expected patterns of the common law does not necessarily mean it is a *bad* argument—nor does it mean that the common law *shouldn't* recognize the argument as legitimate. Can you think of an example of when calling something an "invalid legal argument" could be problematic?
