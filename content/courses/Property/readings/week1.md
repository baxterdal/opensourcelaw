For first-year law students, property law can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, sometimes disorienting. Property spans multiple legal traditions and offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of apparent contradictions. 

The are many possible ways to teach and learn about property, to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will take a critical historical approach that may look different from your other first-year courses. More specifically, we will use the following question about law, history and political economy to thread the material together:

> *How have legal rules about property produced Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and who benefits from the result?* 

In other words, we will take a social concept—*the market*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that concept over time in the Canadian context.

That Canada has a certain kind of market economy, along with that economy's particular distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of choices that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state. By taking a critical look at those choices and what constrains them, we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions and their potential for change. 

These are big ideas and I will have much more to say about this overarching frame in a few weeks. For now, simply be aware that such a frame exists and that we will return to it as a touchstone again and again throughout the course. 

## Course Syllabus

Before you start to read the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the [Course Syllabus]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus" >}}) and reviewing the [Course Schedule]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/schedule" >}}). These are the key documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings.

Ensure that you begin this week with a good understanding of:

- [Course procedures]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#general-information" >}}) for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the [course website and assigned materials]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-website-and-course-materials" >}});

- [Goals and expectations]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-goals-and-expectations" >}}) for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be [evaluated]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#evaluation" >}}) in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to [accommodations, plagiarism and maintaining an inclusive classroom]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#accommodations" >}}).

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and make time for your questions about the syllabus. If questions arise as you read the syllabus for the first time, you can submit them to me (anonymously) ahead of time using the form below.

Short example of connection between colonialism and property. Or a case?

{{% /callout %}}

- colonialism as a particular feature of Canada's liberal market economy that we need to address up front because it is not just an aspect of what we'll learn in the course but a determinant of *how* we learn in the course

- problem statement: How to teach/learn about 1L property when property as a legal institution is at the heart of colonialism? (examples)

- pitfalls: ahistorical; invisibility; subsumation/Indigenous law

- tools to address this problem: (1) identifying and being conscious about relationships and obligations in place-based context; (2) ethic of incommensurability and recognizing "impossible bedfellows"

- exercises: obligations; land acknowledgement  


## Learning in Mi'kmaw Territory

Our class meetings take place in Mi'kmaw territory, and a big part of our course will be about laws that govern or otherwise affect Indigenous lands. 

Many of you will be familiar with the concept of a *land acknowledgement* — the practice of acknowledging the Indigenous territory on which a class, event or meeting is taking place and recognizing or reaffirming the treaty relationships in that territory. A land acknowledgement often used at Dalhousie looks similar to or builds on this statement:

> *Dalhousie University is located in Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq. We are all Treaty people.*

Statements like these play a crucial role in building awareness and renewing ongoing relationships between settler and Indigenous communities. They are especially important for our course, where we will aim for a deeper understanding of legal concepts like "unceded territory" and "Treaty".

One challenge associated with land acknowledgements is that they do not always give the impression of being meaningful or genuine—especially if they come across as formulaic or fail to address the ongoing injustices faced by Indigenous people. That is not a criticism of the practice of land acknowledgements—it is motivation to reflect on the question: *what does acknowledging Mi'kmaw territory mean to you?*

The following exercise is adapted from an excellent open resource on land acknowledgements in the context of business relationships: *[Building Relationships with Business Communication](https://caul-cbua.pressbooks.pub/businesscommunication/chapter/indigenous-land-acknowledgments/)* by Linda Macdonald.

### Draft a Land Acknowledgement

<iframe src="https://native-land.ca/wp-content/themes/Native-Land-Theme/embed/embed.html?maps=territories,treaties&name=mi-kmaq" height="400" width="400"></iframe>

Beginning in 1725, the Mi'kmaq and British entered into and periodically renewed a series of nation-to-nation agreements—treaties—that are still in force today. We will look at these treaty relationships in detail in Week 7. This week we want to highlight one aspect of how these treaty relationships have been interpreted—namely that, in entering these relationships, the Mi'kmaq did not agreed or purport to give up, sell or otherwise "cede" their legal authority over or rights in their lands.

As individuals, you likely come to this course with a range of different understandings and experiences about what else these treaty relationships mean and how they do or should impact your lives. One way to build and communicate this understanding is to try to create your own land acknowledgement. 

**In a few sentences (no more than a paragraph), draft a land acknowledgement that you might use to introduce a meeting or presentation at the law school.** As you do so, consider the following questions:

- What are the purposes and functions of this land acknowledgement? What do you hope to achieve with it?

- What questions does the process of drafting this land acknowledgement raise for you? What more do you want or need to learn about the relationships that underpin this acknowledgement?

- Sometimes a land acknowledgement contains a statement "welcoming" participants to the territory. When might such a statement be appropriate or inappropriate?

Please bring your written acknowledgement to our first class — we will take some time to discuss these together.

## "Law" in this Course

Property law in Canada is comprised of multiple legal orders—Canada is a "multi-juridical" country. Those multiple orders include the Anglo-Canadian common law order, the Franco-Canadian civil law order, and the many diverse Indigenous legal orders that preceded colonial settlement by the British and French and which in many communities persist and continue to thrive. Indigenous legal orders are often not afforded the same respect as other legal orders by settlers and settler institutions, and they have been—in some cases continue to be—violently suppressed or ignored.

We will not study civil law in this course. We will address both common law (including common law doctrines *about* Indigenous peoples) and aspects of some Indigenous legal orders, as well as their points of intersection. We will also delve into general principles that recognize the legal authority of Indigenous nations and their inherent right to self-governance. 

It is important to acknowledge, however, that most of the material we read and analyze in the course is based in the Anglo-Canadian common law tradition. We will aim to be careful to recognize when and how that emphasis risks—even implicitly—reinforcing certain stereotypes about what counts as law and legal reasoning, and we will try to ask the critical question of how the course might better reflect Canada as a multi-juridical country.

### A Note on Terminology

I will try to use the general term "law" in this course to mean any operative system of law but not to refer to any particular legal tradition, as in "law helps us to resolve our disputes and live together in a political community." When talking about a specific legal tradition I will try to label it with as much detail as possible, e.g. "(Anglo-Canadian) common law", "Mi'kmaw law". This practice will aim to reinforce the point that, while these legal orders may look different, they should each be afforded respect and critical attention.

## Patterns of Common Law Argument

In our first unit of the course, [Weeks 1 to 3,]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/schedule" >}}) we will begin to examine certain patterns of common law legal arguments. By this I mean the expected patterns of argument and counter-argument that we tend to get from common law lawyers and judges in courtroom settings, legal decisions, lawyers' briefs and the like. As we will see, these patterns are the basic building blocks of legal argument in the common law tradition and, once you learn to recognize them, you will see that they tend to repeat and reproduce themselves again and again, in case after case.

But before we begin to study the arguments that common law lawyers and judges make, I would like you to think about what kinds of everyday arguments *you* would make or expect to see when confronted with a problem about property. By starting here, we will be able to see some of the similarities and differences between the patterns arguments typically made by lawyers and by non-lawyers.

### Property in Your Cells

![](/media/hela_cells02.jpg)

Various legal rules aim to protect a person's bodily integrity. But in some cases, a person's biological cells might be removed from their body. Consider the following question:

> *Should people continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed from their body?*

Listen to the *Radiolab* podcast below as you think about how you would answer this question and the *arguments* you would use to support that answer. You may also want to think about how you would define "ownership" in this context.

Write down your answer and bring it to class.

We will discuss your answers when we meet this week, but we won't look at a "legal" answer to this problem just yet. Instead, for the remainder of this week and next, we will develop a method for identifying common patterns of legal argument. We'll return to the problem of property in human cells and practice applying this method in Week 3.
