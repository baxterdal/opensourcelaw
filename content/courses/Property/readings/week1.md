For first-year law students, property can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, disorienting. The field offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of contradictions, real and apparent. It presents a space of dispossession and disadvantage for some, prosperity and security for others. 

The are many possible ways to teach and learn about property, to try to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will take a critical, historical approach to the subject--one that puts the emphasis on property's role in Canada's political economy as part of the core legal infrastructure that determines who benefits from that economy and who does not.

## Read the Course Syllabus

Before you start to explore the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the [Course Syllabus]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus" >}}) and reviewing the [Course Schedule]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/schedule" >}}). These are the main documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings and class meetings.

Aim to begin this week with a good understanding of:

- [Course procedures]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#general-information" >}}) for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the [course website and assigned materials;]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-website-and-course-materials" >}})

- [Goals and expectations]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-goals-and-expectations" >}}) for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be [evaluated]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#evaluation" >}}) in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to [accommodations, plagiarism and maintaining an inclusive classroom.]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#accommodations" >}})

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and will make time for your questions about the syllabus. If questions arise as you read the syllabus for the first time, you can submit them to me (anonymously) ahead of time using the form below.

## Making the Market

{{% callout edit %}} 

Can we find a visual here that evokes the "market"? 

{{% /callout %}}

Throughout the course, we will study several controversies, concepts and legal doctrines that conventionally make up the field of property law in Canadian law schools. As in your other courses, you will gain a solid understanding of the "law of the books" addressing a range of issues (local, national and global) and you will see how that law has changed and been adapted over time. But we will do all of this with a more specific goal in mind than becoming proficient in property law. By the end of this course, we want to gain a critical understanding of the following question:

{{% callout question %}} 

*How have legal rules about property created Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and **who benefits** from the result?* 

{{% /callout %}}

In other words, we will take a social concept—the *market*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that concept over time in the Canadian context.

That Canada has a certain kind of market economy, along with that economy's particular distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined (Desautels-Stein 2012, 391). Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of *choices* that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state. By taking a critical look at those choices and what constrains them, we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions along with their potential for change.

Too often, however, we take the legal rules that structure the market for granted and accept that the resulting benefits and burdens are the natural consequences of market competition. From that perspective, law has a role to play but it is one restricted to interventions, by the state, in free exchange between individuals to mitigate its adverse or unequal effects. What this perspective misses is the whole infrastructure of legal rules that make such exchange possible in the first place.

## Land, Property and Colonialism in this Course

One of the features of Canada's liberal market economy is its foundations in the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples through the transformation of *land* into *property* ```[CITE/EXPLAIN]```. But colonialism is not only a feature of our economy, structured by law. It is also an ongoing reality of how we learn about property law (and other aspects of law), including the frameworks we use to make sense of legal materials and the questions we ask about them. 

{{% callout edit %}} 

Description from the literature on property as a colonial institution; land into property.

{{% /callout %}} 

The question for our class at this early stage is how to approach the study of property law as part of an anti-colonial practice. The answer to that question is not simple or easy to generalize, but a useful starting point is what ```[CITE]``` call an "ethic of incommensurability". Incommensurability means ... ```[EXPLAIN]```

The following are three key challenges that attention to this idea of incommensurability can help to address. 

{{% callout info %}} 

### Key Challenges 

- *Ahistoricism*: a lack of concern for the history of land as well as legal rules, principles and doctrines applied to land. The common law's tendency to transform "land" into "property" often has the direct effect of dissociating the land from its history and drawing attention away from historical claims and relationships [@marciamckenzieandevetuckPlaceResearchTheory, 64]. When we remove or ignore the history behind a legal concept like "possession" or "title", it is much easier to cast that concept as natural, neutral and legitimate.

- *Invisibility*: in apparent contradiction to the dynamic of ahistoricism, a second challenge is the temptation to think of colonization only as a historical event rather than a current reality [@tuck2014LandEducationIndigenous, 7]. This way of thinking attempts to make colonialism invisible and to render the obligations flowing from that same history as artifacts rather than living relationships. In a legal context, it often drives us to devise "alternative" explanations for legal doctrines that perpetuate rather than confront colonialism. 

- *Subsumation*: the move to subsume or submerge Indigenous legal systems and systems of knowledge--"entire worlds" [@liboiron2021pollution, 54]--within dominant systems of colonial law and thought is also pervasive in the colonial perspective. Sometimes, instead of making these worlds invisible, subsuming dynamics work to obscure deeper contradictions between principles or worldviews by giving them the gloss of commensurability [@mckay2010CanadianPassiveRevolution, 368-369].

### Incommensurable Obligations

{{% callout exercise %}}

### Exercise

For this exercise, start by taking some time to think of the obligations you bring to this property law course. You might want to start by thinking about what obligations bring you to class each week--what gets you out of your house and into the law school? There are some questions below to help guide your thinking. Take around 10 minutes to write down all the obligations you can think of. 

-  ***Communal***: Do you bring any obligations to your family, friends, classmates, employers (present or future), or other communities to this property law class? 

- ***Personal***: Do you feel any obligations to yourself, your morals, or your beliefs when you think about learning property law? 

- ***Locational***: Do you feel any obligations relating to places you are from or have lived in? Any obligations coming from the place or spaces we are learning property law in?

**STOP: Don't read further until you have your list of obligations.**

Once you have your list of obligations, think about how some of your different obligations might conflict with one another. One way to identify conflicts is to isolate one obligation and imagine it was the only one you had. How would you approach this course if you only had that single obligation? Would that approach change if you introduced another obligation? Take another 10 minutes to identify and write down any potential conflicts or tensions between your obligations. 

There is a form below for you to anonymously submit any of your obligations and conflicts that you feel comfortable sharing. I will review these responses before class and we'll discuss types and trends of responses in-class; however, I won't share any individual responses.

What should we do with the land acknowledgment exercise/concept?

{{% /callout %}}

## Learning in Mi'kmaw Territory

Our class meetings take place in Mi'kmaw territory, and a big part of our course will be about laws that govern or otherwise affect Indigenous lands. 

Many of you will be familiar with the concept of a *land acknowledgement* — the practice of acknowledging the Indigenous territory on which a class, event or meeting is taking place and recognizing or reaffirming the treaty relationships in that territory. A land acknowledgement often used at Dalhousie looks similar to or builds on this statement:

> *Dalhousie University is located in Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq. We are all Treaty people.*

Statements like these play a crucial role in building awareness and renewing ongoing relationships between settler and Indigenous communities. They are especially important for our course, where we will aim for a deeper understanding of legal concepts like "unceded territory" and "Treaty".

One challenge associated with land acknowledgements is that they do not always give the impression of being meaningful or genuine—especially if they come across as formulaic or fail to address the ongoing injustices faced by Indigenous people. That is not a criticism of the practice of land acknowledgements—it is motivation to reflect on the question: *what does acknowledging Mi'kmaw territory mean to you?*

The following exercise is adapted from an excellent open resource on land acknowledgements in the context of business relationships: *[Building Relationships with Business Communication](https://caul-cbua.pressbooks.pub/businesscommunication/chapter/indigenous-land-acknowledgments/)* by Linda Macdonald.

### Draft a Land Acknowledgement

<iframe src="https://native-land.ca/wp-content/themes/Native-Land-Theme/embed/embed.html?maps=territories,treaties&name=mi-kmaq" height="400" width="400"></iframe>

Beginning in 1725, the Mi'kmaq and British entered into and periodically renewed a series of nation-to-nation agreements—treaties—that are still in force today. We will look at these treaty relationships in detail in Week 7. This week we want to highlight one aspect of how these treaty relationships have been interpreted—namely that, in entering these relationships, the Mi'kmaq did not agreed or purport to give up, sell or otherwise "cede" their legal authority over or rights in their lands.

As individuals, you likely come to this course with a range of different understandings and experiences about what else these treaty relationships mean and how they do or should impact your lives. One way to build and communicate this understanding is to try to create your own land acknowledgement. 

**In a few sentences (no more than a paragraph), draft a land acknowledgement that you might use to introduce a meeting or presentation at the law school.** As you do so, consider the following questions:

- What are the purposes and functions of this land acknowledgement? What do you hope to achieve with it?

- What questions does the process of drafting this land acknowledgement raise for you? What more do you want or need to learn about the relationships that underpin this acknowledgement?

- Sometimes a land acknowledgement contains a statement "welcoming" participants to the territory. When might such a statement be appropriate or inappropriate?

Please bring your written acknowledgement to our first class — we will take some time to discuss these together.

## "Law" in this Course

Property law in Canada is comprised of multiple legal orders—Canada is a "multi-juridical" country. Those multiple orders include the Anglo-Canadian common law order, the Franco-Canadian civil law order, and the many diverse Indigenous legal orders that preceded colonial settlement by the British and French and which in many communities persist and continue to thrive. Indigenous legal orders are often not afforded the same respect as other legal orders by settlers and settler institutions, and they have been—in some cases continue to be—violently suppressed or ignored.

We will not study civil law in this course. We will address both common law (including common law doctrines *about* Indigenous peoples) and aspects of some Indigenous legal orders, as well as their points of intersection. We will also delve into general principles that recognize the legal authority of Indigenous nations and their inherent right to self-governance. 

It is important to acknowledge, however, that most of the material we read and analyze in the course is based in the Anglo-Canadian common law tradition. We will aim to be careful to recognize when and how that emphasis risks—even implicitly—reinforcing certain stereotypes about what counts as law and legal reasoning, and we will try to ask the critical question of how the course might better reflect Canada as a multi-juridical country.

### A Note on Terminology

I will try to use the general term "law" in this course to mean any operative system of law but not to refer to any particular legal tradition, as in "law helps us to resolve our disputes and live together in a political community." When talking about a specific legal tradition I will try to label it with as much detail as possible, e.g. "(Anglo-Canadian) common law", "Mi'kmaw law". This practice will aim to reinforce the point that, while these legal orders may look different, they should each be afforded respect and critical attention.

## Patterns of Common Law Argument

In our first unit of the course, [Weeks 1 to 3,]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/schedule" >}}) we will begin to examine certain patterns of common law legal arguments. By this I mean the expected patterns of argument and counter-argument that we tend to get from common law lawyers and judges in courtroom settings, legal decisions, lawyers' briefs and the like. As we will see, these patterns are the basic building blocks of legal argument in the common law tradition and, once you learn to recognize them, you will see that they tend to repeat and reproduce themselves again and again, in case after case.

But before we begin to study the arguments that common law lawyers and judges make, I would like you to think about what kinds of everyday arguments *you* would make or expect to see when confronted with a problem about property. By starting here, we will be able to see some of the similarities and differences between the patterns arguments typically made by lawyers and by non-lawyers.

### Property in Your Cells

![](/media/hela_cells02.jpg)

Various legal rules aim to protect a person's bodily integrity. But in some cases, a person's biological cells might be removed from their body. Consider the following question:

> *Should people continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed from their body?*

Listen to the *Radiolab* podcast below as you think about how you would answer this question and the *arguments* you would use to support that answer. You may also want to think about how you would define "ownership" in this context.

Write down your answer and bring it to class.

We will discuss your answers when we meet this week, but we won't look at a "legal" answer to this problem just yet. Instead, for the remainder of this week and next, we will develop a method for identifying common patterns of legal argument. We'll return to the problem of property in human cells and practice applying this method in Week 3.
