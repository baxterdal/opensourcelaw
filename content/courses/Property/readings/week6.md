In Weeks 4 and 5, we looked at the essential role that possession plays in common law thinking about property. We now turn to the doctrine of Aboriginal title and examine how the common law has come to interpret Indigenous land rights.

Against the background of the material we have covered so far in the course, consider the following two problems we will address this week and next:

### Two Critical Problems

- Mi'kmaw people have lived on and held established relationships with the lands that now comprise Eastern Canada for thousands of years. They did so long before colonial settlement. Because Mi'kma'ki is unceded territory, the common law principles of first possession we have learned about so far imply that the Mi'kmaq continue to hold title. Yet that title was effectively denied by the common law courts in the classical period.

- Mi'kmaw people not only occupied Mi'kma'ki long before colonization, they also governed their relationships with the land according to Mi'kmaw law. They continue to do so. Why should Anglo-Canadian law be the system that determines questions of possession, title and other legal dimensions of lands governance, as the common law courts have long assumed?

We might think of the first problem above as addressing the "internal" perspective of the common law. What is Aboriginal title according to the common law's own logic? The second problem requires an "external" perspective. From the standpoint of a relationship between nations that co-exist with one another, whose system of law can legitimately provide an answer the first problem about the content of Indigenous land rights? This second problem rests on the issue of *sovereignty*, i.e. how and when law-making authority is asserted as between nations. 

We will take the first of these problems as our starting point. We begin with the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*—a document in which King George III of England set out the terms of colonial settlement in British North America after the Seven Years War. In doing so, the British Crown articulated its contemporary interpretation of Aboriginal title and laid the groundwork for subsequent development of that doctrine in the common law courts.

## Royal Proclamation (October 7, 1763) ##

{{< figure src="/media/rp1763.jpg" caption="Royal Proclamation, 1763." >}}

And whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our Interest, and the Security of our Colonies, that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them, or any of them, as their Hunting Grounds,--We do therefore, with the Advice of our Privy Council, declare it to be our Royal Will and Pleasure, that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida, or West Florida, do presume, upon any Pretence whatever, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass any Patents for Lands beyond the Bounds of their respective Governments, as described in their Commissions: as also that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our other Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further Pleasure be known, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass Patents for any Lands beyond the Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the West and North West, or upon any Lands whatever, which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians, or any of them.

And We do further declare it to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure, for the present as aforesaid, to reserve under our Sovereignty, Protection, and Dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the Lands and Territories not included within the Limits of Our said Three new Governments, or within the Limits of the Territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company, as also all the Lands and Territories lying to the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which fall into the Sea from the West and North West as aforesaid,

And We do hereby strictly forbid, on Pain of our Displeasure, all our loving Subjects from making any Purchases or Settlements whatever, or taking Possession of any of the Lands above reserved, without our especial leave and Licence for that Purpose first obtained.

And, We do further strictly enjoin and require all Persons whatever who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any Lands within the Countries above described, or upon any other Lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements.

And whereas great Frauds and Abuses have been committed in purchasing Lands of the Indians, to the great Prejudice of our Interests, and to the great Dissatisfaction of the said Indians: In order, therefore, to prevent such Irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our Justice and determined Resolution to remove all reasonable Cause of Discontent, We do, with the Advice of our Privy Council strictly enjoin and require, that no private Person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any Lands reserved to the said Indians, within those parts of our Colonies where, We have thought proper to allow Settlement: but that, if at any Time any of the Said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said Lands, the same shall be Purchased only for Us, in our Name, at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that Purpose by the Governor or Commander in Chief of our Colony respectively within which they shall lie: and in case they shall lie within the limits of any Proprietary Government, they shall be purchased only for the Use and in the name of such Proprietaries, conformable to such Directions and Instructions as We or they shall think proper to give for that Purpose: And we do, by the Advice of our Privy Council, declare and enjoin, that the Trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all our Subjects whatever, provided that every Person who may incline to Trade with the said Indians do take out a Licence for carrying on such Trade from the Governor or Commander in Chief of any of our Colonies respectively where such Person shall reside, and also give Security to observe such Regulations as We shall at any Time think fit, by ourselves or by our Commissaries to be appointed for this Purpose, to direct and appoint for the Benefit of the said Trade:

And we do hereby authorize, enjoin, and require the Governors and Commanders in Chief of all our Colonies respectively, as well those under Our immediate Government as those under the Government and Direction of Proprietaries, to grant such Licences without Fee or Reward, taking especial Care to insert therein a Condition, that such Licence shall be void, and the Security forfeited in case the Person to whom the same is granted shall refuse or neglect to observe such Regulations as We shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.

And we do further expressly conjoin and require all Officers whatever, as well Military as those Employed in the Management and Direction of Indian Affairs, within the Territories reserved as aforesaid for the use of the said Indians, to seize and apprehend all Persons whatever, who standing charged with Treason, Misprisions of Treason, Murders, or other Felonies or Misdemeanors, shall fly from Justice and take Refuge in the said Territory, and to send them under a proper guard to the Colony where the Crime was committed of which they, stand accused, in order to take their Trial for the same.

Given at our Court at St. James's the 7th Day of October 1763, in the Third Year of our Reign.

## The *St. Catherine's Milling* Case ##

For more than a hundred years, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stood as the British Crown's most authoritative statement on Aboriginal title. But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in the *St. Catherine's Milling Case* in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada's highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.

Set in the two decades after Confederation in 1867, the dispute in *St. Catherine's Milling* between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government was nominally about which level of government held title to public lands within the boundaries of Ontario that had—according to Canada's interpretation of treaty rights—been ceded to the Crown by the Salteaux First Nation as part of Treaty 3 (the North-West Angle Treaty). In the course of trying to resolve that dispute, the common law courts pronounced on the nature of Aboriginal title in ways that had far-reaching consequences.

To understand *St. Catherine's Milling* and is implications, it is important to appreciate the context in which the question of Aboriginal title came before the courts. As Kent McNeil observes in his history of the case, "[t]he 1880s were years of adversity and deprivation for Indigenous peoples, who were facing the unrelenting advance of imperialism in various parts of the world."[^mcneil2019a] "During the same period," McNeil writes, "the taking of Indigenous lands, suppression of Indigenous political authority, and forced assimilation were also proceeding in Canada,"[^mcneil2019b] underpinned by the rising prominence of social darwinism and by westward economic expansion and resulting, among other abuses, in the creation of the residential school system.

### The Facts and Law in *St. Catherine's Milling*

The facts and law in this case are complicated. Essentially, the case involves a dispute between Ontario and Canada as to title in public lands within the political boundaries of Ontario. Understanding the factual and legal context of the case is a useful exercise in learning how to make sense of complex case across multiple judgements. 

I suggest that you start by reading the facts as described in the report of the High Court of Ontario decision, then skip forward to read paragraphs 7-9 of Justice Strong's decision at the Supreme Court of Canada and paragraphs 1-4 of Lord Watson's decisions for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This will give you a basic outline of the case before returning to the first instance decision by Chancellor Boyd.

While the dispute in the case is between Ontario and Canada, we are reading the judgements below in order to understand how the judges' reasons shaped the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. As it turns out, the answer to the question, "What *is* Aboriginal title?" becomes central to resolving the case.  

Procedurally, Ontario succeeds at trail before Chancellor Boyd in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario and in every appeal of that decision that follows. In addition to Chancellor Boyd's decision, we will read Justice Strong dissenting judgement at the Supreme Court of Canada and Lord Watson's decision upon final appeal to the Privy Council in 1888. Each judge approaches the issue of Aboriginal title from a different perspective, and by reading these decisions together we can gain a much deeper understanding of how classical legal thought has shaped common law principles about Indigenous land rights.

### Title vs. Sovereignty

As you read *St. Catherine's Milling*, keep in mind that there are crucial differences between "legal title" (what we normally think of as "ownership", either private or public) and "sovereignty" (a nation's authority to govern itself and its citizens). In *St. Catherine's*, the question of who holds sovereignty over lands in Canada is not in issue—it is assumed that the Crown legitimately has the authority to enact laws governing the land and is vested with an "allodial" or underlying title derived from its presumed sovereignty. We will come back to this important issue next week. *St. Catherine's* concerns the question of title.

This was an action brought by Her Majesty the Queen, on the information of the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario against the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company, claiming amongst other things, an injunction restraining the cutting of timber by the defendants upon certain lands lying south of Wabigoon Lake, in the district of Algoma.

 In the statement of claim it was set out that during the season of the year 1883, the defendants without permission from the Crown or the Province of Ontario, entered upon certain lands situate in and the property of the Province of Ontario, lying south of Wabigoon Lake, in the district of Algoma, and cut pine timber from the said lands amount- ing to about 2,000,000 feet: that the Canadian Pacific Railway ran immediately north of* the said Wabigoon Lake and adjacent thereto, and the defendants had removed about 500,000 feet of the said logs to the north side of the lake, alongside the railway, and intended to remove the same, with the object of having it cut into timber : that of the balance of 2,000,000 feet of pine, some lay on the north side and west side of Wabigoon Lake, the remainder being in the streams and small lakes south of and running into the said lake : that the lands upon which the timber was cut were lands of the Province of Ontario, and the defendants had no right, or title, or authority' whatever entitling them to enter upon the said lands and cut the timber as aforesaid : and the plaintiff claimed a declaration that the defendants had no rights in respect of the timber cut on the said premises, and that the same might be delivered up to the plaintiff : that the defendants might be restrained by the order and injunction of the Court from further trespassing on the said lands, and from cutting timber thereon : that the defendants might be restrained from removing the timber already cut, and might be ordered to pay the damage sustained by the said wrongful acts, and the costs of the action.

By their statement of defence, the defendants alleged that they were a company incorporated under the provisions of the Canada Joint Stock Company Act, 1877, for the purpose of prosecuting a general lumber and milling business within the Dominion of Canada, and in the prosecution of such business, the defendants, during April, 1883, applied to the Government of the Dominion of Canada, and upon payment of $4,125.52 obtained permission from the Government of Canada to enter upon a certain tract of timber lands situate on the south side of Wabigoon lake, in that portion of the Canadian territory, situated between Lake Superior and Eagle lake, which was the timber land referred to in the statement of claim: that pursuant to the leave and license then obtained during the lumbering season of 1883 and 1884, the defendants did cut about 2,000,000 feet of timber on the said tract of timber lands, intending to remove the same : that the said lands and the timber growing thereon were not the property of the Province of Ontario, but of the Dominion of Canada, and of the Crown as represented by the Dominion of Canada: that the Government of Canada acted within its power, and in pursuance of its rights in granting to them the permission and license to cut and remove the timber, and they, the defendants, had acted within their strict legal rights: that the tract of land in question, together with the growing timber thereon, was with other land in the said district or territory until recently claimed by the tribes of Indians who inhabited that part of the Dominion of Canada, and that the claims of such tribes of Indians had always been recognized, acknowledged, admitted, and acquiesced in by the various Governments of Canada and Ontario, and by the Crown, and that such Indian claims were as to the lands in question herein paramount to the claim of the Province of Ontario or of the Crown, as represented by the Government of Ontario, and that the Government of the Dominion of Canada in consideration of a large expenditure of money made for the benefit of the said Indian tribes, and of payment made to them from time to time, and for divers other considerations, had acquired the said Indian title to large tracts of lands in the said territory, including the lands in question in this action, and the timber thereon, and by reason of the acquisition of the said Indian title, as well as by reason of the inherent right of the Crown, as represented by the Government of Canada, the Dominion of Canada, and not the Province of Ontario, had the right to deal with the said timber lands, and at the time of the granting of the said leave and license had, and still have full power and authority to confer upon the defendants the rights, powers, and privileges claimed by them as aforesaid: that long prior to the purchase by the defendants of the right to enter on the said lands and cut the timber, and at the time of such purchase, the Government of Canada had been and were exercising control over the said timber lands, and they, the defendants, made the aforesaid payments and incurred the cost of cutting the said timber in good faith, and the belief that they were acquiring a good and valid title thereto : and the defendants submitted that if the Court granted to the plaintiff the relief claimed, payment should be made to the defendants of the moneys so expended by them.

### Chancellor Boyd's Judgement

Chancellor Boyd's decision below is difficult to read for the racist language it contains and the racist ideology it espouses. We should be mindful of the real harm this language continues to do, even when read as "historical material" through a present lens. 

These aspects of the decision are not incidental to our reasons for reading it—they are closely linked to elements of classical legal reasoning on which the decision is based. Pay close attention to the ways in which Chancellor Boyd's assumptions about and misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples rely on ideas about "natural order" that we have seen in other cases so far in this course.

**Boyd, C.**—

[1] The Province of Ontario seeks the intervention of the Court in order that the St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company may be restrained from trespassing and cutting timber on lands claimed by the Province. The defendants justify under license obtained from the Government of Canada in April, 1883, by virtue of which they assert the right to cut over timber limits on the south side of Wabigoon (or Wabegon) Lake, in that portion of Canada situated between Lake Superior and Eagle Lake. The defendants further plead specially that the place in question forms part of a district till recently claimed by tribes of. Indians, who inhabited that part of the Dominion, and that such claims have always been recognized by the various Governments of Canada and Ontario, and by the Crown ; that such Indian claims were paramount to the claim of the Province of Ontario, and that the Dominion have by purchase acquired the said Indian title, and by reason thereof, as well as by inherent right, the Dominion and not the Province is alone entitled to deal with the said timber limits.

[2] It is admitted that these timber lands are within the territorial limits of Ontario, as determined by the recent decision of the Privy Council. That decision finally ascertained the boundaries assigned to the old Province of Quebec by the Imperial Statute, 14 Geo. III., ch. 83, commonly called " The Quebec Act." By that Act, passed in 1774, it was intended to provide for the permanent government of the newly acquired domain, and to supersede the provisional system introduced by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. By the fourth article of the Treaty of Paris (February 10th, 1763) France ceded Canada with all its dependencies to the Crown of Great Britain. In October of the same year the King's Proclamation erected within part of the ceded territories, the new government of Quebec, the western extension of which was placed at the end of Lake Nipissing. It was speedily found that this boundary excluded a large extent of settled country which was left without civil government, as appears by the preamble to the Quebec Act, and this was cured by fixing the interior boundaries on the lines now established as the western limit of Ontario.

[3] The legal and constitutional effect of the conquest of Quebec and the cession of Canada was to vest the soil and ownership of the public land in the Crown, and to subject the same to the Royal prerogative. The French and Indian populations that remained in the country became, by the terms of capitulation, the subjects of the King. So far as the latter were concerned, it was stipulated in the articles of capitulation concluded at Montreal (on Sept. 8th, 1760) between Major-General Amherst and the Marquis de Vaudreuil as follows: "Article xl: The Savages or Indian allies of His Most Christian Majesty shall be maintained in the lands they inhabit if they choose to remain there: they shall not be molested on any pretence whatsoever for having carried arms and served His Most Christian Majesty; they shall have, as well as the French, liberty of religion, and shall keep their missionaries. Granted"

[4] In 1791 the old Province of Quebec was divided into Upper Canada and Lower Canada by Imperial Statute 31 George III. ch. 31, which, while enlarging the rights of self government, made provision in section 43 for the reservation of alFacts," which shall, in any manner relate to, or affect the King's prerogative touching the granting the waste lands of the Crown within the said Provinces" in order that they might be submitted to the British Parliament before receiving the King's assent. The custody, control, and ownership of all public lands in Upper Canada was transferred to the Provincial Government in 1837 by the Act 7 Will. IV. ch. 118, to which, after being duly reserved, the royal assent was given. In 1840 the Imperial Parliament re-united the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada as one Province by the name of Canada (see 3-4 Vic. ch. 35) a union which subsisted till superseded by the larger union accomplished by the British North America Act. There being a like reservation as to waste land in section 42 of the Union Act, it was by statute 4-5 Vic. ch. 100 of Canada declared that it was expedient to provide a law applicable to all parts of the Province for the disposal of public lands therein. Such a law was embodied in this enactment which received Her Majesty's assent on May 30th. 1842. The comprehensiveness of this Act is manifested by 12 Vic. ch. 31, which applies it to all lands of which the legal estate is in the Crown whether held by Her Majesty for the public uses of the Province, or in the nature of a trust for some charitable or other purpose (sees. 1 and 2.) Section 4 shews that it covers lands " purchased from the Indians," e. g., the "Huron tract." By another Act of the same year, (12 Vic. ch. 30,) provision is made for granting licenses to cut timber on the ungranted lands of the Province, elsewhere therein referred to as growing on the "public lands of the Province," and by section 7 these are enumerated as "Crown, clergy, school, or other public lands of the Province." This is consolidated in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 23.

[5] Such is a brief sketch of the history of the public lands of Ontario from the time of their acquisition by the Crown till they became subject to provincial legislative control.

[6] The colonial policy of Great Britain as it regards the claims and treatment of the aboriginal populations in America, has been from the first uniform and well-defined. Indian peoples were found scattered wide-cast over the continent, having, as a characteristic, no fixed abodes, but moving as the exigencies of living demanded. As heathens and barbarians it was not thought that they had any proprietary title to the soil, nor any such claim thereto as to interfere with the plantations, and the general prosecution of colonization. They were treated "justly and graciously," as Lord Bacon advised, but no legal ownership of the land was ever attributed to them. The Attorney-General in his argument called my attention to a joint opinion given by a "multitude of counsellors," about 1675, touching land in New York, while yet a province under English rule. I think it accurately states the constitutional law in these words :

> Though it hath been and still is the usual practice of all proprietors to give their Indians some recompense for their land, and so seem to purchase it of them, yet that is not done for want of sufficient title from the King or Prince who hath the right of Discovery, but out of prudence and Christian charity least otherwise the Indians might have destroyed the first planters (who are usually too few to defend themselves) or refuse all Commerce and Conversation with the planters, and thereby all hopes of converting them to the Christian faith would he lost. In this the Common law of England and the Civil law doth agree. … Though some planters have purchased from the Indians yet having done so without the Consent of the Proprietors for the time being, the title is good against the Indians but not against the Proprietors without a confirmation from them upon the usual terms of other Plantations."—Vol. xiii. "Documents relating to Colonial History of the State of New York," p. 486.

[7] Of the six counsel who sign this opinion, one (Richard Wallop) became Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer; another (Henry Pollexfen) became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and a third (Holt) was afterwards Chief Justice of England.

[8] In a classical judgment, Marshall, C. J., has concisely stated the same law of the mother-country which the United States inherited and applied with such modifications as were necessitated by the change of government to their dealings with the Indians. I quote passages from *Johnson v. Mcintosh*, 8 Wheat., p. 595, &c.: 

> According to the theory of the British constitution, all vacant lands are vested in the Crown, as representing the nation; and the exclusive power to grant them is admitted to reside in the Crown, as a branch of the royal prerogative. … This principle was as fully recognized in America as in the island of Great Britain. … So far as respected the authority of the Crown no distinction was taken between vacant lands and lands occupied by the Indians. … The title, subject to the right of occupancy by the Indians, was admitted to be in the king, as was his right to grant that title.

At p. 588 : 

> All our institutions recognize the absolute title of the Crown, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and recognize the absolute title of the Crown to extinguish that right.

[9] This right of occupancy attached to the Indians in their tribal character. They were incapacitated from transferring it to any stranger, though it was susceptible of being extinguished. The exclusive power to procure its extinguishment was vested in the Crown, a power which as a rule was exercised only on just and equitable terms. If this title was sought to be acquired by others than the Crown, the attempted transfer passed nothing, and could operate only as an extinguishment of the Indian right for the benefit of the title paramount. See judgment of Burns, J., in *Doe d. Sheldon v. Ramsay*, 9 U.C.R. at p. 133.

[10] Many parliamentary recognitions of these principles might be cited, but let one or two suffice. There is to be found an affirmance of the established doctrine, that the ungranted and waste lands of the country are vested in the Crown, for the public, subject to the Indian title which is capable of being dealt with by way of extinguishment only, and not by way of transfer, in the *Dominion Statute*, 33 Vic. ch. 3, see s. 30, 31 and 32. There is also a very emphatic declaration of the customary Indian lands policy to be found in the address to Her Majesty from the Senate and House of Commons of Canada in December, 1867, praying for the extension of the Dominion to the shores of the Pacific, in which it is represented that upon the transference of the territories in question to the Canadian Government, the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines. Following this up, the same legislative bodies in May, 1869, resolved that upon the transference above mentioned, "it will be the duty of the Government to make adequate provision for the protection of the Indian tribes whose interests and well-being are involved in the transfer." This being embodied in the address subsequently presented to the Queen, the transfer was consummated by Imperial Order in Council of June 23rd, 1870, Article 14 of which stipulated that "any claims of Indians to compensation for lands required for purposes of settlement shall be disposed of by the Canadian Government in communication with the Imperial Government:" 35 Vic. (D.) p. lxiii.

[11] At the time of the conquest, the Indian population of Lower Canada was, as a body, Christianized, and in possession of villages and settlements, known as the "Indian Country." By the terms of capitulation they were guaranteed the enjoyment of these territorial rights in such lands which, in course of time, became distinctively and technically called "Reserves." By a Quebec ordinance of Guy Carleton of 1777, (17 George III. ch. 7, sec. 3,) it was declared unlawful for any person to settle in the Indian country within that Province without a written license from the Governor, and no person was allowed to trade without license in any part of the Province upon lands not granted by His Majesty.

[12] But in Upper Canada the native tribes were in an untaught and uncivilized condition, and it became necessary to work out a scheme of settlement which would promote immigration and protect both red and white subjects so that their contact in the interior might not become collision. A *modus vivendi* had to be adjusted. The course of civilized colonization in the North-West at this day presents, in its essential features, a counterpart of what was going on in the now thickly-populated parts of Upper Canada at the beginning of this century. And the manner of dealing with the rude red-men of the North- West, in the way of negotiating treaties for the surrender of their lands, and conciliating them in the presence of an ever-advancing tide of European and Canadian civilisation is but a reproduction, or rather a continuation and an expansion of the system which had commended itself as the most efficient in Old Canada. The inevitable problem in view of the necessary territorial constriction of the Indian occupants of those vast expanses over which they and their forefathers have fished and hunted and trapped from time immemorial was and is this: how best to subserve the welfare of the whole community and the state, how best to protect and encourage the individual settler, and how best to train and restrain the Indian so that being delivered by degrees from dependency and pupillage, he may be deemed worthy to possess all the rights and immunities and responsibilities of complete citizenship. These three considerations, mainly, have shaped the policy of the Government in the past as in the present. For an admirable *resumé* of what has been done in the earlier history of Canada, I will avail myself of some passages to be found in a joint report of Messrs. Rawson, Davidson & Hepburn, on Indian affairs prepared in 1844, and printed among the Journals of the Legislative Council of Canada, vol. 4, as appendix EEE of the session 1844-1845, and the Journals of the Legislative Assembly of Canada, appendix to vol. 6,, as appendix T of the session of 1847. I may, at this point also mention how greatly I have been indebted to another joint report of Vice-Chancellor Jameson, Mr. Justice Macaulay, and this same Mr. Hepburn, of 1840, which is printed as a supplement to the later report of 1844: Journals of the Legislative Assembly of Canada, appendix to vol. 6, appen- dix No. 1 to appendix T. These two papers form a compendium of valuable knowledge and research not readily accessible elsewhere.

[…]

[13] But it is argued for the defendants that the key to unlock the meaning of the Act of 1867 must be sought in the Royal Proclamation of 1763.

[14] The scope and object of that instrument, therefore, require to be considered. The primary intent of the proclamation was to provide, temporarily, for the orderly conduct of affairs in the settled parts of all the territory newly acquired in America, which was for that purpose subdivided into the four Governments of Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada, and to encourage further settlement by the promise of the immediate enjoyment of English law. Power was conferred upon the governors and councils of the three colonies on the continent to grant such lands as were then or thereafter should be in the power of the Crown to dispose of, on such terms and conditions as might be necessary and expedient for the advantage of the grantees, and the improvement and settlement of the colonies. So far as lands lay without the limits of these colonies, the governors were forbidden to grant patents, or to deal with them, and this chiefly on account of the several nations or tribes of Indians who were living under British protection. That prohibition was to last only "for the present, and till the King's further pleasure" should be known, and it is preceded by a recital that it is just, and reasonable, and essential to our interest, and the security of our colonies, that such Indians with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories, as not having been ceded to or purchased "by us, are reserved for them or any of them, as their hunting grounds."

[15] The proclamation next proceeds to deal with that part of the country which would then embrace the land now in question as follows: " And we do further declare it to be our Royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty, protection, and dominion for the use of the said Indians all the lands and territories not included * * within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company; as also all the land and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the West and North-west as afore- said ; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possesssion of any of the lands above reserved without our especial leave and license for that purpose first obtained; and we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described, or upon any other lands which not having been ceded to, or purchased by us are still reserved to the said Indians, as aforesaid, forthwith, to remove themselves from such settlements."

[16] The proclamation then forbids private persons from presuming to make any purchases from the Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians " within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settle- ment," and directs that if at any time the Indians shall be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the same shall be purchased for us at some public meeting of the Indians to be held for that purpose by the Governor of the colony within which they shall lie.

[17] This proclamation has frequently been referred to, and by the Indians themselves, as the charter of their rights, and the last clause I have condensed relating to the manner of dealing with them in respect to lands they occupy at large, or as a reserve, has always been scrupulously observed in such transactions.

[18] There is an essential difference in meaning between the "reservations" spoken of in the Royal Proclamation, and the like term in the B. N. A. Act. The proclamation views the Indians in their wild state, and leaves them there in undisturbed and unlimited possession of all their hunt- ing ranges, whereas the Act, though giving jurisdiction to the Dominion over all Indians, wild or settled, does not transfer to that government all public or waste lands of the Provinces on which they may be found at large.

[19] The territorial jurisdiction of the Dominion extends only to lands reserved for them. Now it is evident from the history of " the reserves," that the Indians there are regarded no longer as in a wild and primitive state, but as in a condition of transition from barbarism to civilization. The object of the system is to segregate the red from the white population, in order that the former may be trained up to a level with the latter. The key-note of the whole movement was struck unmistakably in 1838, by Lord Glenelg, in his instructions to Sir Francis Bond Head: (Appendix to Journals of Assembly, 1837-8, p. 180.) He wrote thus: " The first step to the real improvement of the Indians is to gain them over from a wandering to a settled life, and for this purpose it is essential that they should have a sense of permanency in the locations assigned to them ; that they should be attached to the soil by being taught to regard it as reserved for them and their children by the strongest securities." The distinctive feature of the system in Canada was the grouping of the separate tribes for the purposes of exclusive and permanent residence within circumscribed limits. Those limits were almost invariably allocated at their usual centres of settlement, and within the ambit of their respective hunting ranges as recognized among themselves. Contrasted with this is the plan chiefly followed in the United States, where the main object has been to mass all the Indian nations and tribes in one vast district called " The Indian Territory," which comprises an area of about 70,000 square miles. But in Canada, the bounds of the separate reserves being ascertained by survey or otherwise, the various communities betake themselves thereto as their "local habitation." Here they are furnished with -appliances and opportunities to make themselves independent of the precarious subsistence procured from the chase; they are encouraged to advance from a nomadic to an agricultural or pastoral life, and thus to acquire ideas of separate property, and of the value of individual rights to which, in their erratic tribal condition, they are utter strangers, so that, ultimately, they may be led to settle down into the industrious and peaceful habits of a civilized people. 

[20] Again: The relations between the Government and the Indians change upon the establishment of reserves. While in the nomadic state they may or may not choose to treat with the Crown for the extinction of their primitive right of occupancy. If they refuse the government is no t hampered, but has perfect liberty to proceed with the settlement and development of the country, and so, sooner or later, to displace them. If, however, they elect to treat they then become, in a special sense, wards of the State, are surrounded by its protection while under pupillage, and have their rights assured in perpetuity to the usual land reserve. In regard to this reserve the tribe enjoy practically all the advantages and safeguards of private resident proprietors : Bastien v. Hoffman, 17 L. C. R. 238. Before the appropriation of reserves the Indians have no claim except upon the bounty and benevolence of the Crown, After the appropriation, they become invested with a legally recognized tenure of defined lands ; in which they have a present right as to the exclusive and absolute usufruct, and a potential right of becoming individual owners in fee after enfranchisement. It is "lands reserved" in this sense for the Indians which form the subject of legislation in the B. JNT. A. Act, i. e., lands upon which or by means of the proceeds of which, after being surrendered for sale, the tribes are to be trained for civilization under the auspices of the Dominion. It follows that lands ungranted upon which Indians are living at large in their primitive state within any Province form part of the public lands, and are held as before Confederation by that Province under various sections of the B. N. A. Act. [See sees. 92 (item 5), also sees. 6, 109 and 117.] Such a class of public lands are appropriately alluded to in section 109- as lands belonging to the Province in which the Indians have an interest, i. e., their possessory interest. When this interest is dealt with by being extinguished, and by way of compensation in part, reserves are allocated, then the jurisdiction of the Dominion attaches to those reserves. But the rest of the land in which "the Indian title" so called has not been extinguished remains with its character unchanged as the public property of the Province.

[*Chief Justice Ritchie, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, affirmed Chancellor Boyd's decision at trial. Justice Strong, whose judgement is below, wrote a dissent from the majority, arguing that Chancellor Boyd's decision should be overturned.*]

**Strong J.** —

[1] By the report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the 23rd July, 1884, made upon a reference to it of the question of disputed boundaries between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which report was adopted by Her Majesty and embodied in the Order in Council of the 11th August, 1884, the territory in which the lands now in question are included was determined to be comprised within the limits of the Province of Ontario. This decision of the Judicial Committee, whilst defining the political boundaries according to the contention of the last named province, does not, however, in any way bear upon the question here in controversy between the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario regarding the proprietorship of the lands now in dispute. The decision of the present appeal depends altogether upon the construction to be placed upon certain provisions of the British North America Act. By the 24th enumeration of section 91 of that act the power of legislation in respect of “Indians and lands reserved for the Indians” is conferred exclusively upon the parliament of Canada By section 109 of the same act,

> All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trust existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.

[2] By sec. 92, enumeration 5, exclusive power of legislation is given to the provinces regarding the management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province, and of the timber and wood thereon.

[3] The contention of the appellants is, that the lands now in question, and which are embraced in the territory formerly in dispute between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which have been decided by the Judicial Committee to be within the boundaries of Ontario, were, at the time of confederation, lands which had not been surrendered by the Indians, and consequently come within the definition of “lands reserved for the Indians” contained in sub-section 24 of section 91, and are therefore not public lands vested in the province by the operation of section 109. The province, on the other hand, insists that these are not “lands reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24, and claims title to them under the provision of section 109 as public lands which at the date of confederation “belonged” to the Province of Ontario.

[4] It is obvious that these lands cannot be both public lands coming within the operation of section 109 and “lands reserved for the Indians,” and so subject to the exclusive legislative power of the parliament of Canada by force of the 24 sub-section of section 91. The “public lands” mentioned in section 109 are manifestly those respecting which the province has the right of exclusive legislation by section 92 sub-section 6. Then, these public lands referred to in sub-section 5, and which include all the lands “belonging” to the province, are clearly distinct from “lands reserved for the Indians,” since lands so reserved are by section 91 sub-section 24 made exclusively subject to the legislative power of the Dominion. To hold that lands might be both public lands within section 109 and sub-section 5 of section 92, and “lands reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24 of section 91, would be to determine that the same lands were subject to the exclusive powers of two separate and distinct legislatures, which would be absurd. This consideration alone is sufficient to dispose of any argument derived from the latter clause of section 109, saving trusts existing in respect of public lands within its operation. Moreover, the trusts thus preserved are manifestly of a different order from anything connected with lands reserved for Indians, for instance, those trusts subsisting in favour of persons who had contracted for the purchase of Crown Lands, but whose titles had not been perfected by grants. The word “trusts” would not be an appropriate expression to apply to the relation between the crown and the Indians respecting the unceded lands of the latter. As will appear hereafter very clearly, such relationship is not in any sense that of trustee and *cestui que trust*, but rather one analogous to the feudal relationship of lord and tenant, or, in some aspects, to that one, so familiar in the Roman law, where the right of property is dismembered and divided between the proprietor and a usufructuary.

[5] It will be convenient here to notice a point to which some importance has been attached in the courts below. It is said, that the British North America Act contains no clause vesting in the Dominion the ultimate property in lands reserved for the Indians over which an exclusive power of legislation is by section 91 conferred on the Dominion Parliament, and that consequently, even though the lands now in question should be held to come within the 24th enumeration of the last mentioned section, yet as they are not vested in the crown in right of the Dominion nothing passed by the lease or license under which the appellants claim title. The answer to this objection is, first, that as this is an information on behalf of the Province complaining of an intrusion upon Provincial lands, the question to be decided in the first instance is that as to the title of the Province. To support the information the respondent must establish that these lands were vested in the Province by the British North America Act, failing which the information must be dismissed, whether the lease or license granted by the Dominion to the appellants conferred a legal title or not. If, therefore, the respondent fails in making out the title of the Province, it is not essential that the appellants should be able to show that under some particular clause of the British North America Act, the lands of which the *locus in quo* forms part were vested in the Dominion. I am of opinion, however, that the ultimate crown title in the lands described in sub-section 24 of section 91, whatever may be the true meaning of the terms employed (an inquiry yet to be entered upon), became, subject to the Indian title in the same, vested in the crown in right of the Dominion. The title and interest of the crown in the lands specified in sub-section 24 at the date of confederation belonged to it in the rights of the respective Provinces in which the lands were situated; for the reasons already given these lands were not vested in the new Provinces created by the confederation act; they must therefore have remained in the crown in some other right, which other right could only have been, and plainly was, that of the Dominion. For, having regard to the scheme by which the British North America Act carried out confederation, by first consolidating the four original Provinces into one body politic — the Dominion — and then re-distributing this Dominion into Provinces and appropriating certain specified property to these several Provinces, it follows that the residue of the property belonging to the crown in right of the Provinces before confederation not specifically appropriated by the appropriation clauses of the act, sections 109 and 117, to the newly created Provinces, must of necessity have remained in the crown, and it is reasonable to presume for the use and purposes of the Dominion. Next, inasmuch as all revenues, casual or otherwise, arising from the title and interest of the crown in “lands reserved for the Indians” (whatever may upon subsequent consideration appear to be the proper meaning of that expression) are by the effect of section 102 allotted to the Dominion, this assignment of revenue to the Dominion, according to a well understood rule of construction, implies a vesting of the land and property from which the revenue is to arise. This last mentioned construction, which is analogous to that so familiar in construing wills by which a gift of rents and profits is held to be equivalent to a gift of the land itself, was referred to with approbation in *Attorney General v. Mercer*, though its application was excluded in that case for the reason that the right of escheat there was held to be expressly vested in the Provinces under section 109, which cannot be the case as regards “lands reserved for the Indians,” over which an exclusive power of legislation is conferred on the Dominion, whatever may appear as the result of further consideration to be the proper meaning attributable to that expression.

[6] The questions to be determined are therefore now restricted entirely to the construction to be placed on the words, “lands reserved for the Indians,” in sub-section 24 of section 91, and we are to bear in mind that whatever are the lands subjected by this description to the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion they cannot be lands belonging to the Province, since all these last mentioned lands are expressly subjected to the exclusive legislative powers of the Provinces. In construing this enactment we are not only entitled but bound to apply that well established rule which requires us, in placing a meaning upon descriptive terms and definitions contained in statutes, to have recourse to external aids derived from the surrounding circumstances and the history of the subject-matter dealt with, and to construe the enactment by the light derived from such sources, and so to put ourselves as far as possible in the position of the legislature whose language we have to expound. If this rule were rejected and the language of the statute were considered without such assistance from extrinsic facts, it is manifest that the task of interpretation would degenerate into mere speculation and guess work.

[7] It is argued here for the appellants, that these words “lands reserved for the Indians” are to have attributed to them a meaning sufficiently comprehensive to include all lands in which the Indian title, always recognized by the crown of Great Britain, has not been extinguished or surrendered according to the well understood and established practice invariably observed by the Government from a comparatively remote period. The respondent, on the contrary, seeks to place a much narrower construction on these words and asks us to confine them to lands, first, which having been absolutely acquired by the crown had been re-appropriated for the use and residence of Indian tribes, and secondly, to lands which, on a surrender by Indian nations or tribes of their territories to the crown, had been excepted or reserved and retained by the Indians for their own residence and use as hunting grounds or otherwise. In order to ascertain whether it was the intention of Parliament by the use of these words “lands reserved for the Indians” to describe comprehensively all lands in which the Indians retained any interest, and so to include unsurrendered lands generally, or whether it was intended to use the term in its restricted sense, as the respondent contends, as indicating only lands which had been expressly granted and appropriated by the crown to the use of Indians, or excepted or reserved by them for their own use out of some large tract surrendered by them to the crown, we must refer to historical accounts of the policy already adverted to as having been always followed by the crown in dealings with the Indians in respect of their lands.

[8] In the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent and in some decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States we have very full and clear accounts of the policy in question. It may be summarily stated as consisting in the recognition by the crown of a usufructuary title in the Indians to all unsurrendered lands. This title, though not perhaps susceptible of any accurate legal definition in exact legal terms, was one which nevertheless sufficed to protect the Indians in the absolute use and enjoyment of their lands, whilst at the same time they were incapacitated from making any valid alienation otherwise than to the crown itself, in whom the ultimate title was, in accordance with the English law of real property, considered as vested. This short statement will, I think, on comparison with the authorities to which I will presently refer, be found to be an accurate description of the principles upon which the crown invariably acted with reference to Indian lands, at least from the year 1756, when Sir William Johnston was appointed by the Imperial Government superintendent of Indian affairs in North America, being as such responsible directly to the crown through one of the Secretaries of State, or the Lords of Trade and Plantation, and thus superseding the Provincial Governments, down to the year 1867, when the confederation act constituting the Dominion of Canada was passed. So faithfully was this system carried out, that I venture to say that there is no settled part of the territory of the Province of Ontario, except perhaps some isolated spots upon which the French Government had, previous to the conquest, erected forts, such as Fort Frontenac and Fort Toronto, which is not included in and covered by a surrender contained in some Indian treaty still to be found in the Dominion Archives. These rules of policy being shown to have been well established and acted upon, and the title of the Indians to their unsurrendered lands to have been recognized by the crown to the extent already mentioned, it may seem of little importance to enquire into the reasons on which it was based. But as these reasons are not without some bearing on the present question, as I shall hereafter shew, I will shortly refer to what appears to have led to the adoption of the system of dealing with the territorial rights of the Indians. To ascribe it to moral grounds, to motives of humane consideration for the aborigines, would be to attribute it to feelings which perhaps had little weight in the age in which it took its rise. Its true origin was, I take it, experience of the great impolicy of the opposite mode of dealing with the Indians which had been practised by some of the Provincial Governments of the older colonies and which had led to frequent frontier wars, involving great sacrifices of life and property and requiring an expenditure of money which had proved most burdensome to the colonies. That the more liberal treatment accorded to the Indians by this system of protecting them in the enjoyment of their hunting grounds and prohibiting settlement on lands which they had not surrendered, which it is now contended the British North America Act has put an end to, was successful in its results, is attested by the historical fact that from the memorable year 1763, when Detroit was besieged and all the Indian tribes were in revolt, down to the date of confederation, Indian wars and massacres entirely ceased in the British possessions in North America, although powerful Indian nations still continued for some time after the former date to inhabit those territories. That this peaceful conduct of the Indians is in a great degree to be attributed to the recognition of their rights to lands unsurrendered by them, and to the guarantee of their protection in the possession and enjoyment of such lands given by the crown in the proclamation of October, 1763, hereafter to be more fully noticed, is a well known fact of Canadian history which cannot be controverted. The Indian nations from that time became and have since continued to be the firm and faithful allies of the crown and rendered it important military services in two wars — the war of the Revolution and that of 1812.

[9] The American authorities, to which reference has already been made, consist (amongst others) of passages in the commentaries of Chancellor Kent, in which the whole doctrine of Indian titles is fully and elaborately considered, and of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, from which three, *Johnston v. McIntosh*, *Worcester v. State of Georgia*, and *Mitchell v. United States*, may be selected as leading cases. The value and importance of these authorities is not merely that they show that the same doctrine as that already propounded regarding the title of the Indians to unsurrendered lands prevails in the United States, but, what is of vastly greater importance, they without exception refer its origin to a date anterior to the revolution and recognise it as a continuance of the principles of law or policy as to Indian titles then established by the British government, and therefore identical with those which have also continued to be recognized and applied in British North America. Chancellor Kent, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in *Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia*, says: —

> The court there held that the Indians were domestic, dependent nations, and their relation to us resembled that of a ward to his guardian; and they had an unquestionable right to the lands they occupied until that right should be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government.

[10] On the same page the learned commentator proceeds thus: —

> The Supreme Court in the case of Worcester reviewed the whole ground of controversy relative to the character and validity of Indian rights within the territorial dominions of the United States, and especially with reference to the Cherokee nation within the limits of Georgia. They declared that the right given by European discovery was the exclusive right to purchase, but this right was not founded on a denial of the Indian possessor to sell. Though the right of the soil was claimed to be in the European governments as a necessary consequence of the right of discovery and assumption of territorial jurisdiction, yet that right was only deemed such in reference to the whites; and in respect to the Indians it was always understood to amount only to the exclusive right of purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell. The royal grants and charters asserted a title to the country against Europeans only, and they were considered as blank paper so far as the rights of the natives were concerned. The English, the French and the Spaniards were equal competitors for the friendship and aid of the Indian nations. The Crown of England never attempted to interfere with the national affairs of the Indians further than to keep out the agents of foreign powers who might seduce them into foreign alliances. The English Government purchased the alliance and dependence of the Indian Nations by subsidies, and purchased their lands when they were willing to sell at a price they were willing to take, but they never coerced a surrender of them. The English Government considered them as nations competent to maintain the relations of peace and war and of governing themselves under her protection. The United States, who succeeded to the rights of the British Crown in respect of the Indians, did the same and no more; and the protection stipulated to be afforded to the Indians and claimed by them was understood by all parties as only binding the Indians to the United States as dependent allies.

[11] Again the same learned writer says;

> The original Indian Nations were regarded and dealt with as proprietors of the soil which they claimed and occupied, but without the power of alienation, except to the Governments which protected them and had thrown over them and beyond them their assumed patented domains. These Governments asserted and enforced the exclusive right to extinguish Indian titles to lands, enclosed within the exterior lines of their jurisdictions, by fair purchase, under the sanction of treaties; and they held all individual purchases from the Indians, whether made with them individually or collectively as tribes, to be absolutely null and void. The only power that could lawfully acquire the Indian title was the State, and a government grant was the only lawful source of title admitted in the Courts of Justice. The Colonial and State Governments and the government of the United States uniformly dealt upon these principles with the Indian Nations dwelling within their territorial limits.

[12] Further, Chancellor Kent, in summarising the decision of the Supreme Court in *Mitchell v. United States*, states the whole doctrine in a form still more applicable to the present case. He says:

> The Supreme Court once more declared the same general doctrine, that lands in possession of friendly Indians were always, under the colonial governments, considered as being owned by the tribe or nation as their common property by a perpetual right of possession; but that the ultimate fee was in the crown or its grantees, subject to this right of possession, and could be granted by the crown upon that condition; that individuals could not purchase Indian lands without license, or under rules prescribed by law; that possession was considered with reference to Indian habits and modes of life, and the hunting grounds of the tribes were as much in their actual occupation as the cleared fields of the whites, and this was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of all the colonies.

[13] It thus appears, that in the United States a traditional policy, derived from colonial times, relative to the Indians and their lands has ripened into well established rules of law, and that the result is that the lands in the possession of the Indians are, until surrendered, treated as their rightful though inalienable property, so far as the possession and enjoyment are concerned; in other words, that the *dominium utile* is recognized as belonging to or reserved for the Indians, though the *dominium directum* is considered to be in the United States. Then, if this is so as regards Indian lands in the United States, which have been preserved to the Indians by the constant observance of a particular rule of policy acknowledged by the United States courts to have been originally enforced by the crown of Great Britain, how is it possible to suppose that the law can, or rather could have been, at the date of confederation, in a state any less favorable to the Indians whose lands were situated within the dominion of the British crown, the original author of this beneficent doctrine so carefully adhered to in the United States from the days of the colonial governments? Therefore, when we consider that with reference to Canada the uniform practice has always been to recognize the Indian title as one which could only be dealt with by surrender to the crown, I maintain that if there had been an entire absence of any written legislative act ordaining this rule as an express positive law, we ought, just as the United States courts have done, to hold that it nevertheless existed as a rule of the unwritten common law, which the courts were bound to enforce as such, and consequently, that the 24th sub-section of section 91, as well as the 109th section and the 5th sub-section of section 92 of the British North America Act, must all be read and construed upon the assumption that these territorial rights of the Indians were strictly legal rights which had to be taken into account and dealt with in that distribution of property and proprietary rights made upon confederation between the federal and provincial governments.

[14] The voluminous documentary evidence printed in the case contains numerous instances of official recognition of the doctrine of Indian title to unceded lands as applied to Canada. Without referring at length to this evidence I may just call attention to one document which, as it contains an expression of opinion with reference to the title to the same lands part of which are now in dispute in this cause by a high judicial authority, a former Chief Justice of Upper Canada, is of peculiar value. In the appendix to the case for Ontario laid before the Judicial Committee in the Boundary Case we find a letter dated 1st of May 1819 from Chief Justice Powell to the Lieutenant Governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, upon the subject of the conflict then going on between the North West and Hudson’s Bay Companies, and of which the territory now in question was the scene. The Chief Justice, writing upon the jurisdiction of the Upper Canada Courts in this territory and of an act of Parliament relating thereto, says:

> The territory which it affects is in the crown and part of a district, but the soil is in the aborigines and inhabited only by Indians and their lawless followers.

[15] There cannot be a more distinct statement of the rights claimed by the appellants to have existed in the Indians than this, and if the soil, *i.e.* the title to the soil, was in the Indians in 1819 it must have so remained down to the date of the North West Angle Treaty No. 3 made in 1873.

[16] Then it is to be borne in mind that the control of the Indians and of the lands occupied by the Indians had, until a comparatively recent period, been retained in the hands of the Imperial Government; for some fifteen years after local self government had been accorded to the Province of Canada the management of Indian affairs remained in the hands of an Imperial officer, subject only to the personal direction of the Governor General, and entirely independent of the local government, and it was only about the year 1855, during the administration of Sir Edmund Head and after the new system of Government had been successfully established, that the direction of Indian affairs was handed over to the Executive authorities of the late Province of Canada. Further, it is to be observed, that by the terms of the 24th sub-section the power to legislate concerning Indians, as distinct from lands reserved, is expressly assigned to the Dominion Government, and this legislative power appears, by the tacit acquiescence of all the new Governments called into existence by confederation, to include the burden of providing for the necessities of the Indians, which has since been borne exclusively by the Government of the Dominion. At all events, the exclusive right of legislating respecting Indian affairs is thus attributed by this clause to the Parliament of Canada. This must include the right to control the exercise by the Indians of the power of making treaties of surrender, and since, as already shown, it is only by means of formal treaties that the Indian title can be properly surrendered or extinguished, Parliament must necessarily have the power, as incident to the general management of the Indians, of so legislating as to restrain or regulate the making of treaties of surrender which might be deemed improvident dispositions of Indian lands. If this were not so, and Parliament did not possess this power of absolute control over the Indians in respect of their dealings with their lands, the provisions of the 24th sub-section would be most incongruous and unreasonable, for in that case, whilst on the one hand Parliament would have to provide for the necessities of the Indians, on the other hand it would not have the means of restraining these wards of the Dominion Government from wasting the means of self support which their hunting grounds afforded. Then, taking into consideration this wide power of legislation respecting the Indian tribes, and seeing that it must necessarily include a power of control over all Indian treaties dealing with proprietary rights, it is surely a legitimate application of the maxim *noscitur a sociis* to construe the words “Lands reserved for the Indians” as embracing all territorial rights of Indians, as well those in lands actually appropriated for reserves as those in lands which had never been the subject of surrender at all.

[17] To summarize these arguments, which appear to me to possess great force, we find, that at the date of confederation the Indians, by the constant usage and practice of the crown, were considered to possess a certain proprietary interest in the unsurrendered lands which they occupied as hunting grounds; that this usage had either ripened into a rule of the common law as applicable to the American Colonies, or that such a rule had been derived from the law of nations and had in this way been imported into the Colonial law as applied to Indian Nations; that such property of the Indians was usufructuary only and could not be alienated, except by surrender to the crown as the ultimate owner of the soil; and that these rights of property were not inaptly described by the words “lands reserved for the Indians,” whilst they could not, without doing violence to the meaning of language, be comprised in the description of public lands which the Provinces could sell and dispose of at their will. Further, we find from the conjunction of the word “Indians” with the expression “lands reserved for the Indians” in the 24 subsection of section 91 of the British North America Act, that a construction which would place unsurrendered lands in the category of “public lands” appropriated to the Provinces would be one which would bring different provisions of the act into direct conflict, since such lands would be subject to the disposition of the local legislature under sub-sec. 5, and at the same time it would be within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, in the exercise of its general right of legislation regarding the Indians, to restrain surrenders or extinguishments of the Indian title to such lands, and thus to render nugatory the only means open to the Provinces of making the lands available for sale and settlement. Then, there being but two alternative modes of avoiding this conflict, one by treating the British North America Act as by implication abolishing all right and property of the Indians in unsurrendered lands, thus at one stroke doing away with the traditional policy above noticed, and treating such lands as ordinary crown lands in which the Indian title has been extinguished, the other by holding that such unsurrendered lands are to be considered as embraced in the description of “lands reserved for the Indians,” it appears to me that the first alternative, which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of taking away proprietary rights, without express words and without any adequate reason, and of doing away at a most inopportune time with the long cherished and most successful policy originally inaugurated by the British Government for the treatment of the Indian tribes, is totally inadmissible and must be rejected. The inevitable conclusion is, that the mode of interpretation secondly presented is the correct one, and that all lands in possession of Indian tribes not surrendered at the date of confederation are to be deemed “lands reserved for the Indians,” the ultimate title to which must be in the crown, not as representing the Province, but in right of the Dominion, the Indians having the right of enjoyment and an inalienable possessory title, until such title is extinguished by a treaty of surrender which the Dominion is alone competent to enter into. To these considerations must be added the further and weighty reason, that the construction just indicated is most fair and reasonable, inasmuch as the Dominion, being burdened with the support and maintenance of the Indians, ought also to have the benefit of any advantage which may be derived from a surrender of their lands.

[18] To these arguments the respondent opposes others of varying weight and importance, which may, as far as I can see, be all classed under two heads. First, it is attempted to show by reference to a variety of documents consisting of legislative and administrative acts, public correspondence and official reports, all of which I concede are quite admissible for the purpose, that the words “lands reserved for the Indians” had, at the time of confederation, acquired a well recognised secondary meaning, and that they were synonymous with Indian reserves and were confined to lands appropriated to the Indians by grant from the crown, or lands which the Indians had themselves reserved by excepting them from treaty surrenders. The answer to this is, in my opinion, very plain. It is true that these documents do show that lands so specifically appropriated to the Indians have always been treated and are to be considered as lands “reserved” for the Indians, and therefore lands comprised in the description given in the 24th subsection of section 91, but it does not follow from this that the clear and undoubted title of the Indians to their peculiar interest in unsurrendered lands is not also included in the same description. The inference would rather be against a construction which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of making a purely arbitrary distinction between the two classes of Indian property, for if it is once admitted or established that the Indians have a proprietary interest in lands not surrendered by them, a point on which there can really be no serious doubt, the same reasons which induced Parliament to throw around the minor territorial interests of the Indians in the smaller classes of reserves the powerful protection of the Dominion Government, or rather stronger reasons than these, must also have applied to their more valuable and important territorial rights in unsurrendered lands.

[19] The other principal argument relied upon for the respondent is one derived from the supposed inconvenience which would result from the proprietary interest in this large tract of territory becoming vested in the Dominion Government. I can see no force in this. I am unable to see that any such result must necessarily, or is even likely, to follow because the proprietorship of the soil in a large tract of land situate within the confines of a particular province is vested in the Dominion, whilst the political rights, legislative and administrative, over the same territory are vested in the provincial government. Instances of such ownership by a federal government within the limits and subject to the jurisdiction of local governments, provinces, or states, are easily to be found, and it has never been suggested that any political inconvenience, or clashing of jurisdiction, has resulted from them. In all the States of the American Union, except the original thirteen and seven others formed out of cessions of territory by original States, viz.: Maine, Vermont, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi, and Texas, (which was admitted to the Union as a state already formed out of foreign territory,) the federal government was the original proprietor of the soil, and still remains so as regards ungranted lands. We may, therefore, presume that a system which has prevailed and still prevails in seventeen states of the Union, and which also exists in our own Province of Manitoba, and must likewise apply to all future provinces formed out of the North-West Territory, cannot be so incompatible with the political rights of local governments, or with the material interests of the people, as to require us to depart from the ordinary and well understood rule of statutory construction, and to ascribe to the Imperial Parliament the intention of abolishing by implication Indian titles which the crown had uniformly recognized for a long course of time, and protection to which had been expressly ordained and guaranteed by a proclamation of the king more than a century old.

[20] The objection that the interests of the public would be prejudiced by attributing the ultimate crown title in Indian lands to the Dominion instead of to the province, seems to imply that this dispute is to be considered as a continuance of the contest respecting the provincial boundaries of Ontario and Manitoba. I cannot assent to this. The question between the two provinces was one in which the rights of two distinct political communities, each representing separate and distinct portions of the general public of the Dominion, came into conflict. In the present case we are entitled, indeed bound, to assume that in the disposal of these lands for the purposes of settlement the interests of the public, as well the public of Ontario as of Canada at large, will be as well served by the Dominion as by the province. I have already shown that the ownership by the Dominion of territory included within the limits of the province, is in no way inconsistent with the political rights of the latter as regards government and legislation. The only real question, therefore, can be and is, that as to which government has the better title to the fund to be produced by the sale of these lands, and if, in construing the statute, we are to take into consideration arguments based on the fairness and equity of giving to one government rather than to the other the title to this fund, I have no hesitation in assigning the better right to the Dominion. I see nothing inequitable or inconvenient, but much the reverse, in a construction of the statute which has the effect of attributing the profits arising from the surrender and sale of Indian lands to the Dominion, upon which is cast the burthen of providing for the government and support of the Indian tribes and the management of their property, not only in the Provinces, but throughout the wide domain of the North-West Territories, rather than upon the Provinces, who are not only free from all liabilities respecting the Indians, but are not even empowered to undertake them and cannot legally do so.

[21] So far as arguments derived from expediency, public policy, and convenience are to have weight in removing any ambiguity which may be fairly raised with reference to the meaning of the terms “lands reserved for the Indians,” there were some invoked by the learned counsel for the appellants which, in my opinion, far exceed in weight any of the same class put forward on behalf of the respondent. Is it to be presumed that by the 109th and 117th sections of the British North America Act it was intended to abrogate entirely the well understood doctrine, according to which the Indians were recognized as having a title to the lands not surrendered by them, which had been acted upon for at least one hundred years, and which had received the express sanction of the crown in a royal proclamation, wherein the Indians are assured that, to the end that they might be convinced of the King’s justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, their lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown should be reserved to them for their hunting grounds? And is it to be supposed that this was done of the mere motion of the Imperial Parliament, without any suggestion or request from the body of delegates assembled in the conference by which the terms and plan of confederation were settled, or otherwise from this side of the Atlantic? And can that be considered a reasonable construction which would attribute to Parliament the intention to make this great change, and thus to break faith with the Indian tribes by abrogating the privileges conferred by a proclamation which they had always regarded as the charter of their rights, just as Canada was on the eve of acquiring from the Hudson’s Bay Company a large territory which would place in subjection to the new Dominion an Indian population far in excess of the aggregate of that contained in all the old Provinces together, a population which it would be of the utmost importance to conciliate, and which would be sure to be affected by any want of good faith practised towards the Indians of the Provinces? Before we can say that the language of the 24th sub-section of section 91 is to receive the interpretation contended for by the respondent, we must be prepared to answer these questions in the affirmative. This I cannot bring myself to do, but I am compelled to prefer the plain primary meaning of the words in question contended for by the appellants, according to which lands reserved for the Indians include unsurrendered lands, or, in other words, all lands reserved for the Indians, and not merely a particular class of such lands.

[22] To the objections just mentioned it is, however, answered, that all the obligations of the crown towards the Indians incidental to their unsurrendered lands, and the right to acquire such lands and to make compensation therefor by providing subsidies and annuities for the Indians, attach to and may be performed by the Provinces as well as by the Dominion. The proper rejoinders to this have been already indicated, but may be more fully stated as follows: First, a construction which, without any adequate reason, would apportion the management of the Indians and their lands between two Governments and two sets of officers, whilst it is obvious that an administration of Indian affairs as a whole by one Government and one set of officers could alone be practicable and beneficial, would be so eccentric and arbitrary that nothing but express words could authorise it. Secondly, the Provinces are Governments of limited capacities, executive as well as legislative, and amongst the powers attributed to the Provincial Governments and Legislatures by the B.N.A. Act none can be found which would authorise such a dealing with Indians in respect of their lands. It cannot be pretended that any such power is conferred in express terms, and none can be implied, since such an implication would be in direct conflict with the only meaning which can be sensibly attached to the word “Indians” as used in the 24th sub-section of section 91, considered apart altogether from the subsequent words “and lands reserved for Indians,” by which word “Indians,” standing alone, it must have been intended to assign to the Dominion the tutelage or guardianship of the Indians and the right to regulate their relations with the crown generally, a duty which could not be properly performed by the Dominion if the tribes were liable to be beset by the Provinces seeking surrenders of their lands. On the whole, therefore, the result is that the construction contended for by the respondent, that unsurrendered Indian lands vested in the Provinces under the 109th and 117th sections, would practically annul the well recognized doctrine of an Indian title in these lands, and for that reason alone is therefore inadmissible.

[23] It appears to me, therefore, that the contentions of the respondent entirely fail, and that were there nothing more to be said the appellants would be entitled to judgment on this appeal.

[24] So far I have considered and dealt with the case upon the assumption that there were no extrinsic circumstances, documents, or course of conduct, from which we could derive assistance in placing a meaning upon the words of the 24th sub-section, beyond the established usage of the crown, according to which the Indians were considered as possessing the proprietary interest already referred to in their unsurrendered lands. It appears, however, that a much stronger case than this is made in favour of the construction contended for by the appellants, for we find that in the proclamation of King George the 3rd, already incidentally alluded to, which had the force of a statute and was in the strictest sense a legislative act, and which had never, so far as I can see, been repealed, but remained, as regards so much of it as is now material, in force at the date of confederation, Indian lands not ceded to or purchased by the king, *i.e.*, lands not surrendered, are expressly described in terms as lands “reserved to the Indians;” the two expressions, “lands not ceded to or purchased by the king,” and “lands reserved to the Indians,” being expressly treated as convertible terms. This proclamation was that of the 7th October, 1763, by which provision was made for the government of certain territories acquired by Great Britain by conquest during the seven years’ war, and which had been ceded by the treaty of peace concluded at Paris between France, England, and Spain on the 10th February, 1763. By this proclamation four separate governments were established, viz., those of Grenada, East and West Florida, and Quebec, and the limits of each province were defined, those of Quebec not comprising the whole territory of Canada ceded by France and being of much smaller extent than those afterwards ascribed to the second province of the same name by the Quebec Act passed in 1774. The description of the territory included in the government of Quebec erected by the proclamation is as follows: —

> First, the government of Quebec, bounded on the Labrador coast by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn from the head of that river through the lake St. John to the south end of Lake Nipissim, from whence the said line crossing the river St. Lawrence, and the Lake Champlain, in 45 degrees of north latitude, passes along the high lands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the sea; and also along the north coast of the Bay of Chaleurs and the coast of the gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres, and from thence crossing the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by the west end of the island of Anticosti, terminates at the aforesaid river of St. John.

[25] This description, manifestly, does not include the lands now in question.

[26] The proclamation, after declaring that the King had issued Letters Patent to the Governors of these several colonies directing the calling of general assemblies for purposes of legislation and some other provisions immaterial here, proceeds to ordain certain regulations respecting Indians and Indian lands as follows: —

> And whereas it is just and reasonable and essential to our interest and the security of our colonies that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds, We do therefore, with the advice of our Privy council, declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that no Governor or Commander in chief in any of our colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida, do presume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of survey, or pass any patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their respective Governments as described in their Commissions; as also, that no Governor or commander in Chief in any of our other colonies or plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents for any lands, beyond the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north-west, or upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians or any of them.

> And we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included within the limits of our said three new Governments, or within the limit of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company; as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved, without our especial leave or licence for that purpose first obtained.

> And we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements.

> And whereas great frauds and abuses have been committed in the purchasing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of our interests, and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians, in order therefore to prevent such irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, we do, with the advice of our Privy Council, strictly enjoin and require, that no private person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement; but if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, in some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that purpose by the Governor or Commander-in-Chief of our colony respectively within which they shall lie.

[27] This same proclamation was the subject of judicial consideration in the celebrated case of *Campbell v. Hall*, and its effect and operation was fully considered by Lord Mansfield in his judgment in that case.

[28] As is well known, it was determined in the case of *Campbell v. Hall*, that the king had power to legislate as regards ceded and conquered colonies, and that this identical proclamation now under consideration had the force of law in the colonies to which it applied, though it was also determined that the king, having by it ordained the calling of legislative assemblies in the several colonies mentioned, his power of legislation was thereby exhausted, and that a subsequent proclamation with reference to Grenada was of no legislative force. In the present case the importance of this proclamation is paramount, and appears to me to be by itself decisive of the present appeal. In the first place, it gives legislative expression and force to what I have heretofore treated as depending on a regulation of policy, or at most on rules of unwritten law and official practice, namely, the right of the Indians to enjoy, by virtue of a recognized title, their lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown; it prohibits all interference with such lands by private persons by way of purchase or settlement, and limits the right of purchasing or obtaining cessions of Indian lands to the king exclusively. Next, by the words “to lands which not having been ceded to or purchased by us are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid,” it indicates that “lands reserved for the Indians” was a description and definition applicable to, and indeed convertible with, unsurrendered or nonceded lands. It thus furnishes us with a key to the meaning of the words “lands reserved for the Indians,” an expression which appears to have originated in this proclamation, and it entitles us, whenever we find the same words used in a statute or public document without a context indicating that it is used in some restricted sense, to infer that it includes those rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands which it was one of the principal purposes of the proclamation to assure to them. If the effect of this proclamation as applicable to the present case stopped here it would, as it seems to me, be conclusive, for being a legislative act having the force of a statute it has never, in my opinion, been repealed, but has, so far as it regulates the rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands, remained in force to the present day. It was, therefore, in force at the date of the passage of the British North America Act, and, if I am correct in this, I am warranted in saying that in the face of its express provisions that Indian lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown shall be considered “lands reserved to the Indians,” it is impossible to reject the equivalent interpretation that lands reserved for the Indians mean lands not ceded by the Indians, which is all the appellants contend for. But this proclamation has, as it appears to me, an application far beyond that already mentioned. It not only gives us a clue to the meaning of the term “lands reserved for or to the Indians,” but it applies directly and in terms to the present lands. By the first clause of the extract from the proclamation which I have read the King declares it to be his will and pleasure to reserve under his sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all land and territory not included (1) within the limits of “our said three Governments,” (2) or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, (3) also all lands westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north west. Now this territory, of which the lands in question form part, and one controversy as to which was determined by the Order-in-Council of August, 1884, was clearly not comprised within the limits of the first Province of Quebec, as those limits were defined by this proclamation of October, 1763, nor was it included within the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, nor did it lie to the west or north-west of the sources of the rivers falling into the Atlantic ocean. Then, what were the lands not included within the three Governments, nor within the Hudson’s Bay territory, to which the proclamation refers as being thereby reserved for the Indians? Clearly it has reference to the residue of the territories mentioned at the outset of the proclamation, viz., the “countries and islands ceded and confirmed to us by the said treaty.” And if this is correct, and I fail to see how it can be otherwise, this identical tract of territory now in question was, by this proclamation, which in *Campbell v. Hall* was adjudged to have legislative force, reserved to and set apart for the use of the Indians, and this provision of the proclamation, never having been repealed, nor in any way derogated from by any subsequent legislation, remained in full force as a subsisting enactment up to the passing of the confederation act. In other words, it is a legislative act, applying directly to the lands now in question, assuring to the Indians the right and title to possess and enjoy these lands until they thought fit of their own free will to cede or surrender them to the crown, and declaring that, until surrender, the lands should be reserved to them as their hunting grounds, and being still in full force and vigor when the British North America Act was passed, it operated at that time as an express legislative appropriation of the land now in dispute for the use and benefit of the Indians by the designation of “lands reserved to the Indians.” Therefore the effect of the 24th sub-section of section 91 of the British North America Act upon these lands, as lands “reserved to the Indians” by the proclamation, must be precisely the same as if, by an act of Parliament passed the day before the British North America Act, it had been declared that these same lands, designated by some appropriate description, should be “reserved to the Indians,” in which case it could hardly be pretended that they were not lands “reserved for the Indians” within sub-section 24 of section 91, but public lands belonging to the Province under sections 109 and 117 and subject to the exclusive legislation of the Province under sub-section 5 of section 92.

**Lord Watson** —

[1] On the 3rd of October, 1873, a formal treaty or contract was concluded between commissioners appointed by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, of the one part, and a number of chiefs and headmen duly chosen to represent the Salteaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians, of the other part, by which the latter, for certain considerations, released and surrendered to the Government of the Dominion, for Her Majesty and her successors, the whole right and title of the Indian inhabitants whom they represented, to a tract of country upwards of 50,000 square miles in extent. By an article of the treaty it is stipulated that, subject to such regulations as may be made by the Dominion Government, the Indians are to have right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the surrendered territory, with the exception of those portions of it which may, from time to time, be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering, or other purposes.

[2] Of the territory thus ceded to the Crown, an area of not less than 32,000 square miles is situated within the boundaries of the Province of Ontario; and, with respect to that area, a controversy has arisen between the Dominion and Ontario, each of them maintaining that the legal effect of extinguishing the Indian title has been to transmit to itself the entire beneficial interest of the lands, as now vested in the Crown, freed from incumbrance of any kind, save the qualified privilege of hunting and fishing mentioned in the treaty.

[3] Acting on the assumption that the beneficial interest in these lands had passed to the Dominion Government, their Crown Timber Agent, on the 1st of May, 1883, issued to the appellants, the St. Catherine’s Milling and Lumber Company, a permit to cut and carry away one million feet of lumber from a specified portion of the disputed area. The appellants having availed themselves of that license, a writ was filed against them in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario, at the instance of the Queen on the information of the Attorney-General of the Province, praying — (1) a declaration that the appellants have no rights in respect of the timber cut by them upon the lands specified in their permit; (2) an injunction restraining them from trespassing on the premises and from cutting any timber thereon; (3) an injunction against the removal of timber already cut; and (4) decree for the damage occasioned by their wrongful acts. The Chancellor of Ontario, on the 10th of June, 1885, decerned with costs against the appellants, in terms of the first three of these conclusions, and referred the amount of damage to the Master in Ordinary. The judgment of the learned Chancellor was unanimously affirmed on the 20th of April, 1886, by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and an appeal taken from their decision to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed on the 20th of June, 1887, by a majority of four of the six judges constituting the court.

[4] Although the present case relates exclusively to the rights of the Government of Canada to dispose of the timber in question to the appellant company, yet its decision necessarily involves the determination of the larger question between that government and the Province of Ontario with respect to the legal consequences of the treaty of 1873. In these circumstances, Her Majesty, by the same order which gave the appellants leave to bring the judgment of the Court below under the review of this Board, was pleased to direct that the Government of the Dominion of Canada should be at liberty to intervene in this appeal, or to argue the same upon a special case raising the legal question in dispute. The Dominion Government elected to take the first of these courses, and their Lordships have had the advantage of hearing from their counsel an able and exhaustive argument in support of their claim to that part of the ceded territory which lies within the provincial boundaries of Ontario.

[5] The capture of Quebec in 1759, and the capitulation of Montreal in 1760, were followed in 1763 by the cession to Great Britain of Canada and all its dependencies, with the sovereignty, property, and possession, and all other rights which had at any previous time been held or acquired by the Crown of France. A royal proclamation was issued on the 7th of October, 1763, shortly after the date of the Treaty of Paris, by which His Majesty King George erected four distinct and separate Governments, styled respectively, Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada, specific boundaries being assigned to each of them. Upon the narrative that it was just and reasonable that the several nations and tribes of Indians who lived under British protection should not be molested or disturbed in the “possession of such parts of Our dominions and territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds,” it is declared that no governor or commander-in-chief in any of the new colonies of Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, do presume on any pretence to grant warrants of survey or pass any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their respective governments, or “until Our further pleasure be known,” upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded or purchased as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians or any of them. It was further declared “to be Our Royal will, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under Our sovereignty, protection, and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included within the limits of Our said three new Governments, or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company.” The proclamation also enacts that no private person shall make any purchase from the Indians of lands reserved to them within those colonies where settlement was permitted, and that all purchases must be on behalf of the Crown, in a public assembly of the Indians, by the governor or commander-in-chief of the colony in which the lands lie.

[6] The territory in dispute has been in Indian occupation from the date of the proclamation until 1873. During that interval of time Indian affairs have been administered successively by the Crown, by the Provincial Governments, and (since the passing of the British North America Act, 1867), by the Government of the Dominion. The policy of these administrations has been all along the same in this respect, that the Indian inhabitants have been precluded from entering into any transaction with a subject for the sale or transfer of their interest in the land, and have only been permitted to surrender their rights to the Crown by a formal contract, duly ratified in a meeting of their chiefs or headmen convened for the purpose. Whilst there have been changes in the administrative authority, there has been no change since the year 1763 in the character of the interest which its Indian inhabitants had in the lands surrendered by the treaty. Their possession, such as it was, can only be ascribed to the general provisions made by the royal proclamation in favour of all Indian tribes then living under the sovereignty and protection of the British Crown. It was suggested in the course of the argument for the Dominion, that inasmuch as the proclamation recites that the territories thereby reserved for Indians had never “been ceded to or purchased by” the Crown, the entire property of the land remained with them. That inference is, however, at variance with the terms of the instrument, which shew that the tenure of the Indians was a personal and usufructuary right, dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign. The lands reserved are expressly stated to be “parts of the dominions and territories;” and it is declared to be the will and pleasure of the sovereign that, “for the present,” they shall be reserved for the use of the Indians, as their hunting grounds, under his protection and dominion. There was a great deal of learned discussion at the Bar with respect to the precise quality of the Indian right, but their Lordships do not consider it necessary to express any opinion upon the point. It appears to them to be sufficient for the purposes of this case that there has been all along vested in the Crown a substantial and paramount estate, underlying the Indian title, which became a *plenum dominium* whenever that title was surrendered or otherwise extinguished.

[7] By an Imperial statute passed in the year 1840 (3 & 4 Vict. c. 35), the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, then known as Upper and Lower Canada, were united under the name of the Province of Canada, and it was, inter alia, enacted that, in consideration of certain annual payments which Her Majesty had agreed to accept by way of civil list, the produce of all territorial and other revenues at the disposal of the Crown arising in either of the united Provinces should be paid into the consolidated fund of the new Province. There was no transfer to the Province of any legal estate in the Crown lands, which continued to be vested in the Sovereign; but all moneys realized by sales or in any other manner became the property of the Province. In other words, all beneficial interest in such lands within the provincial boundaries belonging to the Queen, and either producing or capable of producing revenue, passed to the Province, the title still remaining in the Crown. That continued to be the right of the Province until the passing of the British North America Act, 1867. Had the Indian inhabitants of the area in question released their interest in it to the Crown at any time between 1840 and the date of that Act, it does not seem to admit of doubt, and it was not disputed by the learned counsel for the Dominion, that all revenues derived from its being taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering, and other purposes would have been the property of the Province of Canada. The case maintained for the appellants is that the Act of 1867 transferred to the Dominion all interest in Indian lands which previously belonged to the Province.

[8] The Act of 1867, which created the Federal Government, repealed the Act of 1840, and restored the Upper and Lower Canadas to the condition of separate Provinces, under the titles of Ontario and Quebec, due provision being made (sec. 142) for the division between them of the property and assets of the United Province, with the exception of certain items specified in the fourth schedule, which are still held by them jointly. The Act also contains careful provisions for the distribution of legislative powers and of revenues and assets between the respective Provinces included in the Union, on the one hand, and the Dominion, on the other. The conflicting claims to the ceded territory maintained by the Dominion and the Province of Ontario are wholly dependent upon these statutory provisions. In construing these enactments, it must always be kept in view that, wherever public land with its incidents is described as “the property of” or as “belonging to” the Dominion or a Province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use, or to its proceeds, has been appropriated to the Dominion or the Province, as the case may be, and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Crown.

[9] Sec. 108 enacts that the public works and undertakings enumerated in Schedule 3 shall be the property of Canada. As specified in the schedule, these consist of public undertakings which might be fairly considered to exist for the benefit of all the Provinces federally united, of lands and buildings necessary for carrying on the customs or postal service of the Dominion, or required for the purpose of national defence, and of “lands set apart for general public purposes.” It is obvious that the enumeration cannot be reasonably held to include Crown lands which are reserved for Indian use. The only other clause in the Act by which a share of what previously constituted provincial revenues and assets is directly assigned to the Dominion is sec. 102. It enacts that all “duties and revenues” over which the respective legislatures of the United Provinces had and have power of appropriation, “except such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective legislatures of the Provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by this Act,” shall form one consolidated fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada. The extent to which duties and revenues arising within the limits of Ontario, and over which the legislature of the old Province of Canada possessed the power of appropriation before the passing of the Act, have been transferred to the Dominion by this clause, can only be ascertained by reference to the two exceptions which it makes in favour of the new provincial legislatures.

[10] The second of these exceptions has really no bearing on the present case, because it comprises nothing beyond the revenues which provincial legislature are empowered to raise by means of direct taxation for Provincial purposes, in terms of sec. 92 (2). The first of them, which appears to comprehend the whole sources of revenue reserved to the provinces by sec. 109, is of material consequence. Sec. 109 provides that “all lands, mines, minerals, and royalities belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalities, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Province in the same.” In connection with this clause it may be observed that, by sec. 117, it is declared that the Province shall retain their respective public property not otherwise disposed of in the Act, subject to the right of Canada to assume any lands or public property required for fortifications or for the defense of the country. A different form of expression is used to define the subject-matter of the first exception, and the property which is directly appropriated to the Province; but it hardly admits of doubt that the interests in land, mines, minerals, and royalities, which by sec. 109 are declared to belong to the Province, include, if they are not identical with, the “duties and revenues” first excepted in sec. 102.

[11] The enactment of sec. 109 are, in the opinion of their Lordships, sufficient to give to each Province, subject to the administration and control of its own Legislature, the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries, which at the time of the union were vested in the Crown, with the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under sec. 108, or might assume for the purposes specified in sec. 117. It legal affect is to exclude from the “duties and revenues” appropriated to the Dominion, all the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown arising within the Province. That construction of the statute was accepted by this Board in deciding *Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer*, 8 App. Cas. 767, where the controversy related to land granted in fee simple to a subject before 1867, which became eshceat to the Crown in the years 1871. The Lord Chancellor (Earl Selbourne) in delivering judgment in that case, said, 8 App. Cas. 776: “It was not disputed, in the argument for the Dominion at the bar, that all territorial revenues arising within each Province from ‘lands’ (in which term must be comprehended all estates in land), which at the time of the union belonged to the Crown, were reserved to the respective Provinces by sec. 109; and it was admitted that no distinction could, in that respect, be made between lands then ungranted, and lands which had previously reverted to the Crown by escheat. But it was insisted that a line was drawn at the date of the union, and that the words were not sufficiant to reserve any lands afterwards escheated which at the time of the union were in private hands, and did not then belong to the Crown. Their Lordships indicated an opinion to the effect that the escheat would not, in the special circumstances of that case, have passed to the Province as “lands;” but they held that it fell within the class of rights reserved to the Provinces as “royalities” by sec. 109.

[12] Had its Indian inhabitants been the owners in fee simple of the territory which they surrendered by the treaty of 1873, *Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer*, 8 App. Cas. 767, might have been an authority for holding that the Province of Ontario could derive no benefit from the cession, in respect that the land was not vested in the Crown at the time of the union. But that was not the character of the Indian interest. The Crown has all along had a present proprietary estate in the land, upon which the Indian title was a mere burden. The ceded territory was at the time of the union, land vested in the Crown, subject to “an interest other than that of the Province in the same,” within the interest other than that of meaning of sec. 109; and must now belong to Ontario in terms of that clause, unless its rights have been taken away by some provision of the Act of 1867 other than those already noticed.

[13] In the course of the argument the claim of the Dominion to the ceded territory was rested upon the provisions of sec. 91 (24), which in express terms confer upon the Parliament of Canada power to make laws for “Indians, and lands reserved for the Indians.” It was urged that the exclusive power of legislation and administration carried with it, by necessary implication, any patrimonial interest which the Crown might have had in the reserved lands. In reply to that reasoning, counsel for Ontario referred us to a series of provincial statutes prior in date to the Act of 1867, for the purpose of shewing that the expression “Indian reserves” was used in legislature language to designate certain lands in which the Indians had, after the royal proclamation of 1763, acquired a special interest, by treaty or otherwise, and did not apply to land occupied by them in virtue of the proclamation. The argument might have deserved consideration if the expression had been adopted by the British Parliament in 1867, but it does not occur in sec. 91 (24), and the words actually used are, according to their natural meaning, sufficient to include all lands reserved, upon any terms or conditions, for Indian occupation. It appears to be the plain policy of the Act that, in order to ensure uniformity of administration, all such lands, and Indian affairs generally, shall be under the legislative control of one central authority.

[14] Their Lordships are, however, unable to assent to the argument for the Dominion founded on sec. 92 (24). There can be no a *priori* probability that the British Legislature, in a branch of the statute which professes to deal only with the distribution of legislative power, intended to deprive the Province of rights which are expressly given them in that branch of it which relates to the distribution of revenues and assets. The fact that the power of legislating for Indians, and for lands which are reserved to their use, has been intrusted to the Parliament of the Dominion is not in the least degree inconsistent with the right of the Provinces to them as a source of revenue whenever the estate of the Crown is disencumbered of the Indian title.

[15] By the treaty of 1873 the Indian inhabitants ceded and released the territory in dispute, in order that it might be opened up for settlement, immigration, and such other purpose as to Her Majesty might seem fit, “to the Government of the Dominion of Canada,” for the Queen and Her successors for ever. It was argued that a cession in these terms was in effect a conveyance to the Dominion Government of the whole rights of the Indians, with the consent of the Crown. That is not the natural import of the language of the treaty, which purports to be from beginning to end a transaction between the Indians and the Crown. Even if its language had been more favourable to the argument of the Dominion upon this point, it is abundantly clear that the commissioners who represented Her Majesty, whilst they had full authority to accept a surrender to the Crown, had neither authority nor power to take away from Ontario the interest which had been assigned to the province by the Imperial Statute of 1867.

[16] These considerations appear to their Lordships to be sufficient for the disposal of this appeal. The treaty leaves the Indians no right whatever to the timber growing upon the lands which they gave up, which is now fully vested in the Crown, all revenues derivable from the sale of such portions of it as are situate within the boundaries of Ontario being the property of that Province. The fact, that it still possesses exclusive power to regulate the Indian’s privilege of hunting and fishing, cannot confer upon the Dominion power of dispose, by issuing permits or otherwise, of that beneficial interest in the timber which has now passed to Ontario. Seeing that the benefit of the surrender accrues to her, Ontario must, of course, relieve the Crown, and the Dominion, of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty, and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion Government. There may be other questions behind, with respect to the right to determine to what extent, and at what periods, the disputed territory, over which the Indians still exercise their avocations of hunting and fishing, is to be taken up for settlement or other purposes, but none of these questions are raised for decision in the present suit.

[17] Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada ought to be affirmed, and the appeal dismissed. It appears to them that there ought to be no costs of the appeal.
