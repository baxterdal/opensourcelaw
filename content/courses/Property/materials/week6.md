Over the past few weeks, we have studied the special role that common law property affords to possession and the relationship of that concept to legal title. In the case of "unowned" things--like the wild seals we studied in *Clift v Kane*--showing physical control (plus an intention to control) amounts not only to possession while such control is sustained, but also to title as legally-recognized ownershipâ€”at least, if the animal can no longer "escape". Exactly *how* one can establish sufficient control is, as we saw, often difficult to define and heavily dependent on the circumstances. 

Last week, we turned out attention more squarely to possession and title in land. Recalling that Locke applied his labour theory of first possession equally to personal and real property (i.e., to "things" and "land"), we saw how that application of that principle was long denied to Indigenous peoples as the original inhabitants of the Americas by characterizing their relationships to land to as a "personal and usufructuary right" in the eyes of common law judges. 

This week, we continue to build our understanding of the relationship between *possession* and *title*. Our overarching question in Week 6 is as follows:

Why is title in land--as distinguished from "mere possession" of land--important? What are its justifications and consequences as part of the basic structure of a liberal market economy?

We start by taking up this question in a particular place and context: contemporary movements toward "clarification" of land titles in African Nova Scotian communities as a means to address historical discrimination and anti-Black racism in the distribution of land in Nova Scotia. These movements have placed heavy emphasis on the regularization and formalization of land titles for individuals and families in possession of land, and can help us to understand--and develop a critical perspective on--the social role of legal title. With this case study and the questions it raises in mind, we then move on to two crucial doctrinal points. The first of these addresses the fundamentally *relative* nature of possession and the entitlements afforded to those in possession but lacking title. The second returns to Locke's idea of possession as the basis for title in a the context of *adverse possession*.
