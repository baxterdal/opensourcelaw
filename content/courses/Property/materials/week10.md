Our final topic this term—and in the domain of classical common law thought—is the right to *alienate* property (i.e. the right sell or otherwise transfer it). Recall that we have already encountered alienation and restraints on alienation in the context of Aboriginal title going back to the Royal Proclamation in 1763. As we learn this week, the extent to which landowners can and should be able transfer their property rights to others and to place limits on alienation has long been a central issue in common law property.

As you will see from *Blackburn v McCallum* and *Re Walker*, below, these courts place a heavy emphasis on the free alienability of land. Any attempts to restrict free alienability are viewed with considerable scepticism in the classical style—consistent with the liberal ideal that property rights should support individuals to pursue their own ends. For example, in both *Blackburn* and *Walker*, the courts scrutinize clauses in a will that purport to limit how or when beneficiaries under that will can transfer the property interests they receive. This emphasis on free alienability has also become crucial for modern understandings of property as the basis for a market economy. 

In order to understand the controversies around alienability in *Blackburn* and *Walker*, you first need a bit of background on the common law doctrines of tenure and estates. This is a big topic—the primer below offers an overview and covers key terms.
