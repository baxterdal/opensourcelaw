For first-year law students, property can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, disorienting. The field offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of contradictions, real and apparent. It presents a space of dispossession and disadvantage for some, prosperity and security for others. 

The are many possible ways to teach and learn about property, to try to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will take a critical, historical approach to the subject--one that puts the emphasis on property's role in Canada's political economy as part of the core legal infrastructure that determines who benefits from that economy and who does not.
