This week, which begins Unit 3, we move away from the classical period of legal reasoning we studied last term and into the second style of liberal legal thought we'll confront in the course: the *modern style*. To do so, we will return to a topic we analyzed in Week 9—the field of expropriation and the extent to which property owners can exclude the state from taking away or otherwise interfering with "their" property rights. 

With the move to online for the start of Winter term, we'll pivot to a problem-based learning model for each week of the course. My hope is that this will reduce the amount of time you need to spend in online lectures (where we know ability to absorb and process new information is limited) and allow each of you more flexibility in allocating your "in-class" time for studying the course materials in a way that works best for you. 

In practical terms, this modified approach means that I will start each week's readings by presenting a fact pattern-based problem that explores the relevant legal issue(s) for the week. We will then use this problem to develop an understanding of the assigned cases and other materials. I have recorded a series of mini-lectures and included these throughout the readings to guide your study of the materials—think of these as a replacement for an online Zoom session, but one that is more usefully integrated with your reading. We will then meet virtually once per week to discuss and address answers to the problem, based on your preparation of the materials.
