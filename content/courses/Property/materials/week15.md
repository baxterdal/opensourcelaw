### Mini-Lecture: Recap from Week 14

{{< vimeo 673820548 >}}
{{% /callout %}}

Last week, we asked whether the doctrine of *public policy* could be applied to invalidate a restrictive covenant that imposed minimum lot and building sizes on the servient tenement, with consequences for urban affordable housing development. In the context of last week's materials, the public policy doctrine served to limit the enforcement of agreements between neighbours as durable property rights and restrictions incident to titleâ€”that is, rights and restrictions that "run with the land". 

This week we will continue to unpack and examine the public policy doctrine in a different context, namely that of bequests in a will (*testamentary transfers*). We ask the question: to what extent can and should the doctrine place limits on the freedom of owners to do what they want with their property after they die? 

The material we study this week will take us back to the concept of *estates in land* introduced in Week 10 when we looked at restraints on alienation. I suggest that you briefly review the [section on tenures and estates from Week 10](../week10/#tenures--and-estates) before jumping into the readings for this week. 

*Stuartburn v Kiansky*, next, brings us back to the idea of life estates and remainder interests, raising the question of whether one can be considered an "owner" of land if they hold only a remainder in fee simple (a "remainderman interest"). The case draws an important distinction between an interest in *possession* and a *future* interest in land and tees up a further distinction between *vested* and *contingent* interests crucial for understanding *Canada Trust Co* and *McCorkill* below.
