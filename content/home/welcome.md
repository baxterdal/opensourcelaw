Opensourcelaw.ca is an experimental platform to host open-source legal casebooks based on the Jamstack standard using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/?utm_campaign=poweredby). The goal is to build a framework for online casebook publishing that not only creates free learning materials for law students but also supports collaboration, flexibility, adaptation and creative freedom among authors and teachers.
