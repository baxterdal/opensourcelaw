opensourcelaw.ca is an experimental platform for building open source legal casebooks through a process called *commons-based peer production*. The move toward greater openness in higher education is growing, but the degree to which authors of open materials genuinely collaborate with one another to create and maintain those materials too rarely lives up to the movement's potential. Our approach aims to change these dynamics for open legal casebooks by making collaborative authorship itself more accessible and by giving participants the capacity for greater flexibility and creative freedom--including the freedom to sustain disagreements about materials, interpretations and pedagogies within the scope of collective projects. 

The basic idea behind this approach is to make open casebook production more like the classic example of commons-based peer production: open source software development. We aim to adopt some of the key tools, mindsets and processes used everyday by open software developers, without the need to write computer code or learn complex systems for data or knowledge management. 

The opensourcelaw.ca platform itself is built using fully open-source software ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/), and [Tina)](https://tina.io) and backed by [Github,](http://github.com) meaning that authors retain full control over their content. What this means in practical terms is that anyone willing to invest a bit of time in learning this approach is free to copy not only the casebooks themselves *but also the means to create and publish them*. 

At present, the implementation of these ideas is still in "beta". We are experimenting, testing, and revising--primarily through the *Land and Property in Canada's Political Economy* casebook--to develop a process of peer production for legal casebooks that is both workable in practice and true to the ideals of access and openness.
