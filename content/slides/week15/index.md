## Problem

> A testator, recently deceased, has two surviving adult children who are the sole beneficiaries of the testator’s will. The will establishes a private trust whose terms stipulate that, in order for the eldest of the two children to receive their share of the estate property they must divorce and cease to cohabitate with their spouse. If the eldest child fails to meet this condition within five years of the testator’s decease, the whole residue of the estate will pass to the other beneficiary.

### *Canada Trust Co v Ontario*

Justice Robinson and Justice Tarnopolsky agree that the conditions in the trust should be struck out. How do their decisions differ?

{{< slide id="agenda_slide">}}

Based on *Canada Trust Co* and on *McCorkill*, is the condition in our hypo this week likely to be invalid because it is against public policy? Why or why not?
