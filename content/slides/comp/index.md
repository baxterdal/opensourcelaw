## Week 9

### Single Firm Practices I

---

## Abuse of Dominance

<aside class="notes">

Single-firm practices that an anti-competitive.

Seems like it should be a primary tool in the competition law toolbox. But in fact it is quite an onerous charge to make out. 

Is this a good thing or not?

### *Competition Act*, s 79

<small>

> 79 (1) Where, on application by the Commissioner, the Tribunal finds that
>
> (a) one or more persons **substantially or completely control**, throughout Canada or any area thereof, a class or species of business,
>
>(b) that person or those persons have engaged in or are engaging in a practice of **anti-competitive acts**, and
>
>(c\) the practice has had, is having or is likely to have the effect of **preventing or lessening competition substantially** in a market,
>
>the Tribunal may make an order prohibiting all or any of those persons from engaging in that practice.

<small>In 2014, the Competition Bureau launched an investigation into several of Loblaws policies applied and enforced against its suppliers. One of those policies (the "Active Ad Match Policy") imposed penalities (deductions) on suppliers when a competitor's advertised price was lower that Loblaw's price for the supplier's product, resulting in Loblaws to automatically match the competing price.</small>

<small>**Is this an abuse of dominant position? How do you know?**</small>

<aside class="notes">

3 steps:

1. "Substantially or completely control" a class or species of business: market share

2. "Engaged in a practice of anti-competitive acts": must be for anti-competitive PURPOSE. What is that purpose (e.g. incentivizing suppliers to raise prices to competitors or incentivizing suppliers to reduce rivalry between retailers, e.g. pressuring retailers to follow suggested price lists or adhere to certain advertising policies)? Is it possible that motivated by a pro-competitive purpose? 

3. "Preventing or lessening competition substantially": is there evidence of harm? Bureau concluded in 2017 that there was insufficient evidence to conclude lessening of competition.

#### 79(1)(a) "Substantially or completely control"

A substantial degree of market power that "confers upon an entity considerable latitude to determine or influence price or non-price dimensions of competition in a market, including the terms upon which it or others carry on business in the market." 

<aside class="notes">

Factors the Bureau will consider:

- market share and barriers to entry (share >50% attracts scrutiny)

- ability to exclude competitors (e.g. by controlling inputs or platforms--doesn't meant that firm competes directly in the market)

- counter-veiling power of competitors and conditions for technological change 

</aside>

--

#### 79(1)(b) Anti-competitive Acts

Activities that have an anti-competitive purpose, i.e. one intended to have a negative effect on a competitor that is **predatory, exclusionary, or disciplinary**. 

<aside class="notes">

Predatory: pricing below cost to eliminate, discipline, or deter entry or expansion of a competitor. 

Exclusionary: non-price practices intended to exclude competitors (e.g. exclusive dealing; tying and bundling)

Disciplinary: dissuading a competitor from competing (e.g. fighting brands; selling below acquisition cost) -- linked to collusive practices (disciplining members of cartel who deviate, e.g. by lowering prices) -- also intended to *reveal information* about other firms in cartel

</aside>

#### 79(1)(c\) Competitive Effects

Does the impugned practice materially increase market power? 

<aside class="notes">

When will abuse of dominant position result in "preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market"?

Bureau looks to material increase in market power, particularly with respect to barriers to entry or expansion. Factors include:

- prices
- product quality and choice
- ease of switching between products or suppliers

As we saw in the Loblaws example, this can be hard to prove and often acts as a bar to successfully prosecuting a claim, even where dominance and anti-competitive purpose can be shown.

### Predatory Pricing

Setting price below costs for a period of time sufficient to eliminate, discipline or deter a competitor in the expectation that the firm will recoup its losses by charging higher prices later.

**Examples?**

<aside class="notes">

Intuitively, PP seems like a real threat and a key focus for competition law. But a considerable amount of ink has been expended to make the case the PP isn't really a problem. How do we know?

![](amazon.jpg)

Do you think Amazon is currently engaging in a predatory pricing strategy? How do you know and what if anything should be done about it? 

<aside class="notes">

EXAMPLE: Amazon pricing bestseller e-books at $9.99 (below cost at which they purchased from publishers)

Last week and this week, we saw that the conventional (Chicago) approach to this question is to ask: **it is rational for Amazon to engage in PP?**

Two aspects: (1) plausible theory that pricing below cost yields net benefits for Amazon? (2) other rationales for pricing below cost (e.g. loss leading?)

Khan argued that this conventional approach is inadequate to address the question of whether or not Amazon is engaged in PP. We want to understand both the Chicago approach and Khan's critique.

Nick: evidence that Amazon basically earned no profit in its first 20 years. Argues that these were reinvested in growing the company to reach scale. Do we know if Amazon earned profit and reinvested, or if it attracted equity investors and used that to capitalize? 

Anna: loss leading vs PP. 

Chicago approach: does theory predict that PP will happen? 

**Long purse:**

- Predator loses more than the prey: increased production (so bears costs that prey doesn't) AND disproportionate loss from lower prices because of greater market share

- Merger is a comparable strategy to PP and generally preferable because it avoids reduction in industry profits (but these mergers are illegal when they give rise to substantial market power)

- Bork: much turns on exit/entry barriers -- if it is easy to exit and re-enter, the PP isn't likely to be very effective (competitors will just re-enter when prices rise again)

- Plus: costs are immediate but benefits are quite long-term and must be discounted 

- Less convincing is Posner's theory that consumer's wouldn't accept lower prices because it is against their long-term interests

**Reputation:**

- If a firm can gain a reputation for predation, this maybe yield net benefits -- especially true when firm competes in several markets at once (predation in one market gives reputation that deters entry etc in other markets )

**Signalling:**

- By setting prices low, incumbent firm is signalling to potential entrants that prices will remain low and maybe deter them from entering at all (b/c, e.g. incumbent has convinced them that their costs are actually low = depends on asymmetric information)

Specific features of Amazon case:

- steep discounting on platform-based goods creates higher risk of monopoly power (lock-in effects; ease of access to platform)

- RECOUPMENT: Amazon can recoup its losses by other means than simply raising prices in the future 

- Price trends are exceptionally hard to track 

Khan's approach:

Roche Pharmaceuticals gave away Valium for 12 months to hospitals when compulsory licencing was introduced. They later claimed they wanted to be a “good corporate citizen”. What further information would you need to know before making a claim that this behaviour is predatory?

#### What legal rule for predatory pricing?

- *per se* legality 

- price-cost (*per se* illegal; presumption; two-stage)

<aside class="notes">

Per se legal: PP basically isn't a problem, so pricing below cost should generally be allowed (even if it lets a few PP through)

Per se illegal: to sell below average variable cost. 

- Are there legitimate reasons to price below cost? (e.g. perishable inventory; promoting new products)

Presumption of illegality when price is below long-term marginal cost

- focus on long-term rather than short-term costs

- rebuttable presumption 

Two stage:

- (1) assess whether market conditions suitable for PP to exit
- (2) price-cost test 
- seems to get closer to Khan's "structural analysis"

Average avoidable cost.

Pricing above cost. -->

### Price Discrimination

When a firm charges significantly different prices to two or more customers but where costs do not differ significantly (i.e. different ratios of price to marginal cost). 

**What is the harm here? Examples?**

<aside class="notes">

Harm = firm exercises market power to generate monopoly profits from some customers. But is there a welfare loss? 

Caution = not all price discrimination is bad (e.g. when there are real cost difference between customer groups; short-term market adjustments; absence of any price discrimination can signal cartel)

Firm must be able to (1) sort customers (high and low demand elasticity) and (2) prevent arbitrage 

Response example (Claire? Meghan?): airplane tickets. 

- Why is there first class versus economy class? Airlines lower quality of economy seats so that first-class customers don't buy them (not because first-class is expensive to provide)

</aside>

Assume that a seller is able to perfectly price discriminate (i.e., charge each buyer the maximum price they are willing to pay). 

Should the Competition Bureau be worried about such conduct?

<aside class="notes">

No - this is allocatively efficient (equal to the perfect competition scenario, i.e. same level of output)

Yes - distribution problem = all consumer surplus under the perfect price discrimination scenario is captured by the producer (but no social welfare loss)

</aside>

--

![](monopoly.png)

<aside class="notes">

When a monopolist does not price discriminate, they earn monopolist profits but price out some lower-demand buyers altogether.

With some price discrimination, monopolist can increase profits while also increasing social welfare.

But when no price discrimination, higher-demand customers will enjoy some consumer surplus. 

</aside>

--

Second- and third-degree price discrimination

<aside class="notes">

Seller divides buyers into groups based on higher or lower demand. 

2nd degree: self-selection (seller chooses price-quantity-quality package to induce customer to reveal their type by the package they choose)  = airline tickets 

3rd degree: seller sells identical quantity-quality packages to different types of customers at difference prices = seniors and student discounts at movie theaters (older people and students have higher elasticity of demand, so they are charged a lower price)

Ambiguous welfare effects compared to single price case. 

- In general, some degree of price discrimination benefits high-demand buyers and disadvantages low-demand buyers. 

- Possible that price discrimination increased output and is therefore welfare enhancing

- Possible that price discrimination results in deadweight los (e.g. small number of high-demand customers = discrimination may result in loss of some customers and corresponding output reduction)

</aside>

--

#### So why prohibit price discrimination?

<aside class="notes">

Concerns:

- future prices increases resulting from injury to competition

- protection of small businesses 

Example: big retailers drive out small retailers through discriminatory prices practices by their suppliers (they charge prices too high for the smaller businesses)
