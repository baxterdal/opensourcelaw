### Gray's Rule

"A person who catches a baseball that enters the stands is its owner. A ball is caught if the person has achieved complete control of the ball at the point in time that the momentum of the ball and the momentum of the fan while attempting to catch the ball ceases."

### FInkleman and Bernhardt's Rule

The first possessor of a baseball must be "actively and ably engaged in efforts to establish complete control. Moreover, such efforts must be significant and they must be reasonably calculated to result in unequivocal dominion and control at some point in the near future."

### Which Rule? 

- Which rule (Gray vs Finkleman-Bernhardt) does the court choose, and why?

- How is this rule, and the Court's reasons for choosing it, different from *Clift v Kane*? Are seals the same as or different than baseballs?
