### Gray's Rule

"A person who catches a baseball that enters the stands is its owner. A ball is caught if the person has achieved complete control of the ball at the point in time that the momentum of the ball and the momentum of the fan while attempting to catch the ball ceases."

### FInkleman and Bernhardt's Rule

The first possessor of a baseball must be "actively and ably engaged in efforts to establish complete control. Moreover, such efforts must be significant and they must be reasonably calculated to result in unequivocal dominion and control at some point in the near future."

### Which Rule? 

- Which rule (Gray vs Finkleman-Bernhardt) does the court choose, and why?

- How is this rule, and the Court's reasons for choosing it, different from *Clift v Kane*? Are seals the same as or different than baseballs?

## Problem 1

> Two children are playing on a beach and see an old abandoned boat washed up on shore. They both run for it. The faster one nearly reaches the vessel but trips on a piece of driftwood and sprains their ankle. The second child then overtakes the first, jumps on board and declares the boat "mine!". Who owns the boat?

## Problem 2

> You client recently purchased a winter cottage, on a modest tract of land at the side of a mountain, adjacent to a popular ski resort in a small town. The resort owns land above and below the cottage and has recently unveiled plans to run one portion of a new ski lift directly over your client's land. Permanent cables for the lift would run less than 20 feet above the cottage. Is there a legal basis on which your client could challenge development of the proposed ski lift? Does it matter that the resort cannot continue to operate without expanding its access to the mountain and that over half of the town's residents are employed there?
