### Key Issues

How will existing limits on s. 7 right shelter coming out of *Adams* be applied?

1. Right is exercisable when the number of homeless persons outnumber the available indoor sheltering spaces;

2.  Right is confined to overnight hours.

## Covenants Running in Equity

## Burdens

1. Covenant must be negative in substance

2. Covenant must evidence an intention for the burden to run with the servient land.

3. Covenant must "touch and concern" (benefit) the dominant lands.

4. Purchaser of the servient lands has notice of the covenant.
