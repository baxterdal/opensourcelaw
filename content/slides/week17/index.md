## Aboriginal Title after *Guerin*



---





{{< slide id="agenda_slide">}}

### Review: *St. Catherine's Milling*

1. Aboriginal title is a "personal and usufructuary right".

2. Aboriginal title finds its source in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, making these rights "dependent on the goodwill of the sovereign".

3. Aboriginal title is inalienable, except to the Crown.

4. Aboriginal title can be "surrendered or otherwise extinguished".

### Crown's Fiduciary Duty 

> "The Crownâ€™s obligation to the Indians with respect to that interest is therefore not a public law duty. While it is not a private law duty in the strict sense either, it is nonetheless in the nature of a private law duty. Therefore, in this sui generis relationship, it is not improper to regard the Crown as a fiduciary." (*Guerin*, para 26)
