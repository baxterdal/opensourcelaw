## Title vs Possession

From the common law’s perspective, “legal title” and “legal possession” are distinct concepts. One might hold title without being in possession, or one might be in possession without title. Sometimes, possession can serve as the basis for (or “ripen” into) title, and in exceptional cases a possessor can displace the holder of legal title altogether.

## What is adverse possession?

*Possession by a non-owner that can result in the owner losing title* (or, more accurately, that results in a legal prohibition against the title holder bringing a claim to eject the adverse possessor). 

In Nova Scotia, adverse possession must be "open, notorious, adverse, exclusive, peaceful, actual, and continuous" for a period of twenty years (*Downey*).
