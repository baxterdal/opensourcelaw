## Title vs Possession

From the common law’s perspective, “legal title” and “legal possession” are distinct concepts. One might hold title without being in possession, or one might be in possession without title. Sometimes, possession can serve as the basis for (or “ripen” into) title, and in exceptional cases a possessor can displace the holder of legal title altogether.
