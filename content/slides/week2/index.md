### Exercise: Laskin's "Solution"

Re-read paragraphs 33-34 of Chief Justice Laskin's decision, where he presents a "solution" to the problem of competing proprietary and labour interests. In effect, Laskin proposes that members of the public be entitled to use public areas of the shopping centre free from the threat of trespass (exclusion by the owner) as long as they have a good reason for being there and aren't damaging the property or otherwise acting unlawfully. 

Can you think of any other possible solutions that still achieve the result Laskin is arguing for?

## Structure of Argument

{{< slide id="">}}

### Patterns

Common law arguments are highly patterned, and the structure of those arguments — though not necessarily the outcome of arguing — is fairly predictable. These patterns of argument recur again and again in the cases we will read this year. Becoming proficient in common law arguments means being able to recognize and make use of these patterns.

### Vocabulary vs Grammar





---





{{< slide id="">}}

**Argument type**: a group or category of arguments that share the same basic structure.

**Argument bite**: one of two "sides" that go together to form an argument; a couplet of position/counter-position or move/counter-move. 

> *Plaintiff has a right to do X, therefore plaintiff should succeed.*

> *These facts justify a limitation on plaintiff’s right to do X in the circumstances, therefore defendant should succeed.*

### Four Argument Types

- Denial of Premise

- Symmetrical Opposition

- Counter-Theory

- Mediation

---

### Denial of Premise

**Factual Premise**

Plaintiff: *I have a right to exclude other people from my land.*

Defendant: *Yes, but you do not own the land.*

**Normative Premise**

Plaintiff: *I have a right to use my land in any way I choose, even if it means harming others or destroying the land itself.*

Defendant: *I acknowledge that you own the land, but no such right to unconstrained use of land exists in the common law.*

Write down an argument bite that denies the premise (factual or normative) of the following:

> *Law school is an ideal place to develop a commitment to justice, which every law student must do to become a good lawyer.*



---

### Symmetrical Opposition

Plaintiff: *I have a right to do what I want on my land without interference from others.*

Defendant: *I have a right to freely express myself wherever I choose.*





---





{{< slide id="">}}

Write down an argument bite symmetrically opposed to the following:

> *As a law student I have a right to learn in an institution committed to seeking justice.*



---





{{< slide id="">}}

### Counter-Theory

Plaintiff: *the proper role of common law courts is to apply the law as they find it, not to make it.*

Defendant: *the proper role of common law courts is to adapt the law to meet changing conditions and the needs of society.*





---





{{< slide id="">}}

Write down an argument bite that offers a counter-theory to the following:

> *The primary goal of the law school is to develop a sense of justice in its students.*



---

### Mediation

Plaintiff: *I have a right to exclude other people from my land.*

Defendant: *You have a right to exclude other people from your land, but only when you can offer a legitimate reason for doing so.*





---





{{< slide id="">}}

Write down an argument bite that attempts to mediate the following:

> *The primary goal of the law school is to develop a commitment to justice in its students.*

## *Harrison v Carswell*

The goal of this exercise is to practice applying the framework for identifying argument types to see the underlying structure of common law argument in the judgement.  

Keep in mind that argument types are effectively ***heuristics*** to help us grasp the key insight that common law arguments are **highly patterned**.
