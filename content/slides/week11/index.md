## *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*




---





{{< slide id="">}}

Key ideas from *Mahon*

- It would be impossible to compensate landowners for every government act or decision that diminished property values in some way.

- Private property rights are not absolute, but inherently limited by the "police power" of the state.

- Control over unfettered competition and blurring the line between private property and public interest.

> Government hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation, and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits â€¦ (*Mahon*, para 3)
