- Source of Aboriginal title: Royal Proclamation and prior possession

- Content of Aboriginal title: a *sui generis* interest in land whose nature is not exhausted by the concept of a personal right but is characterized by its general inalienability.

- Surrender of Aboriginal title: Crown is under a fiduciary obligation to deal with the land on behalf of the title-holding Nation if surrendered.

### Sufficiency

> [T]he reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty require[s] that account be taken of the “aboriginal perspective while at the same time taking into account the perspective of the common law” and that “[t]rue reconciliation will, equally, place weight on each”. (*Delgamuukw*, para 49)

### Continuity

> Where present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, a second requirement arises — continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation. (*Tsilhqot'in*, para 46)

### Exclusivity

> Indigenous nations must have had “the intention and capacity to retain exclusive control” over the lands. (*Tsilhqot'in*, para 48, quoting *Delmaguukw*)

### *Terra Nullius*

> At the time of assertion of European sovereignty, the Crown acquired radical or underlying title to all the land in the province. This Crown title, however, was burdened by the pre-existing legal rights of Aboriginal people who occupied and used the land prior to European arrival. The doctrine of terra nullius (that no one owned the land prior to European assertion of sovereignty) never applied in Canada, as confirmed by the Royal Proclamation (1763), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1. (*Tsilhqot'in*, para 70)

## Infringement

### Test for Justified Infringement

> <small>In the wake of Gladstone, the range of legislative objectives that can justify the infringement of [A]boriginal title is fairly broad. Most of these objectives can be traced to the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by [A]boriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty, which entails the recognition that “distinctive [A]boriginal societies exist within, and are a part of, a broader social, political and economic community” (at para. 73). In my opinion, the development of agriculture, forestry, mining, and hydroelectric power, the general economic development of the interior of British Columbia, protection of the environment or endangered species, the building of infrastructure and the settlement of foreign populations to support those aims, are the kinds of objectives that are consistent with this purpose and, in principle, can justify the infringement of [A]boriginal title. (*Tsilhqot'in*, para 85, quoting from *Delgamuukw*)</small>
