### Puzzle: *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*

> Government hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation, and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits â€¦ (*Mahon*, para 3)

> The general rule, at least, is that, while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking. (*Mahon*, para 9)
