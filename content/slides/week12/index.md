### Role of the Police Power

> [T]he nature of an activity must be defined in reference to the perception and values of the society. (Gonthier, para 54)

> It is open to the municipality as a legislator to introduce such value judgments into its land use controls (as it did here under the new by-law), but I do not think the landowner’s “acquired right” to continue to carry on business can retroactively be truncated in this way on the present state of the law. (Binnie, para 8)
