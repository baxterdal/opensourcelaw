- What is the scope of acquired rights (once vested)?

### Framing the Issue

> … an inevitable conflict between the need of homeless individuals to perform essential, life-sustaining acts in public and the responsibility of the government to maintain orderly, aesthetically pleasing public parks and streets. (*Adams*, para 1, quoting *Pottinger v Miami*)

### Contingent Right to Shelter

How is HRM likely to argue that its evictions were not a violation of the occupants' s.7 rights?

### Adequacy of Shelter Options

> "However, the fact remains that there are many more homeless people in Victoria than available shelter. It therefore does not really matter whether some homeless people prefer to sleep in shelters or not — there is not sufficient room for them in the shelters. Moreover, as noted earlier, many of the Defendants deposed that they have been turned away from shelters. This is consistent with the other evidence before the Court. I note further that the Mayor’s Task Force Report submitted into evidence by the City did not conclude that there are sufficient shelter spaces for all who wish to use them." (*Adams*, para 37)

> “…[t]here is no evidence to suggest the General Manager turned her mind to the specific needs of those sheltering in the Park or whether the available shelter spaces were suitable to their needs. As recognized by the jurisprudence since Adams, the suitability of available shelter spaces, in addition to the number of available spaces, is relevant to the constitutional right of sheltering in a public park. (*Bamberger*)

### Summary

How will existing limits on s. 7 right shelter be applied?

1. Right is exercisable when the number of homeless persons outnumber the available indoor sheltering spaces;

2.  Right is confined to overnight hours.
