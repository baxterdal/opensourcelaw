*We are meeting for our first Property class today on Mi'kma'ki, the territory of the Mi'kmaw Nation — a meeting made possible by the Treaties of Peace and Friendship. I take seriously my responsibility to renew these treaty relationships and do the work needed to address when those relationships have been broken or disrespected. For me, this work includes helping to steward the land and water in practices of day-to-day life, continuing to learn about Mi'kmaw laws and the treaties, and finding new ways to bring this learning into the classroom.*
