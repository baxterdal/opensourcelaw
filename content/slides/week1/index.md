## Intro to the Course

##

*We are meeting for our first Property class today on Mi'kma'ki, the territory of the Mi'kmaw Nation — a meeting made possible by the Treaties of Peace and Friendship. I take seriously my responsibility to renew these treaty relationships and do the work needed to address when those relationships have been broken or disrespected. For me, this work includes helping to steward the land and water in practices of day-to-day life, continuing to learn about Mi'kmaw laws and the treaties, and finding new ways to bring this learning into the classroom.*

### Exercise: Laskin's "Solution" 

Re-read paragraphs 33-34 of Chief Justice Laskin's decision, where he presents a "solution" to the problem of competing proprietary and labour interests. In effect, Laskin proposes that members of the public be entitled to use public areas of the shopping centre free from the threat of trespass (exclusion by the owner) as long as they have a good reason for being there and aren't damaging the property or otherwise acting unlawfully. 

Can you think of any other possible solutions that still achieve the result Laskin is arguing for?
