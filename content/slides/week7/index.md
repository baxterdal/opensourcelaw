### Key Doctrinal Outcomes (JCPC)

*St. Catherine's Milling*:

1. Aboriginal title is a "personal and usufructuary right".

2. Aboriginal title finds its source in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, making these rights "dependent on the goodwill of the sovereign".

3. Aboriginal title is inalienable, except to the Crown (pre-emption).

4. Aboriginal title can be "surrendered or otherwise extinguished".

*Please read [this article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/first-nations-new-brunswick-1.6211638) about a recent memo circulated by the Attorney General in New Brunswick requiring a provincial land acknowledgement that excludes the words "unceded" and "unsurrendered".*

Based on our reading of the Peace and Friendship Treaties, how would you respond to the Attorney General's position? What do you think is motivating this position?

## *R v Syliboy*

On what assumptions about Mi'kmaw rights, law and governance does Justice Patterson's decision rest? 

- Structure of Mi'kmaw governance

- Static vs dynamic nature of treaty relationship

- Legal status of treaties

- Indigenous nationhood and sovereignty

> "The prerogative Treaties enabled the two worldviews and different societies to make a new normative world using the irony of jurisdictions, obligations and rights. To live in the new legal world required each culture to know not only the meaning of the alliance and its terms, but also the connections or transformations that resulted when one normative system passed through another. The prerogative Treaties constructed, through mutual consent, a new normative system out of the various constructions of reality and visions of what the world might be." — James (Sa’ke’j) Youngblood Henderson

**What needs to change in the common law system (principles, institutions, actors, etc) to move us closer to Henderson's vision?**
