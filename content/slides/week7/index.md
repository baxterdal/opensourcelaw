### Key Doctrinal Outcomes (JCPC)

*St. Catherine's Milling*:

1. Aboriginal title is a "personal and usufructuary right".

2. Aboriginal title finds its source in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, making these rights "dependent on the goodwill of the sovereign".

3. Aboriginal title is inalienable, except to the Crown (pre-emption).

4. Aboriginal title can be "surrendered or otherwise extinguished".
