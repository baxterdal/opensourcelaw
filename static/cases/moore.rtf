[1] We granted review in this case to determine whether plaintiff has stated a cause of action against his physician and other defendants for using his cells in potentially lucrative medical research without his permission. Plaintiff alleges that his phys
ician failed to disclose preexisting research and economic interests in the cells before obtaining consent to the medical procedures by which they were extracted. The superior court sustained all defendants\rquote 
 demurrers to the third amended complaint, and the Court of Appeal reversed. We hold that the complaint states a cause of action for breach of the physician\rquote s disclosure obligations, but not for conversion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [3] The plaintiff is John Moore (Moore), who underwent treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA Medical Center). The five defendants are: (1) Dr.\~
David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; (2) the Regents of the University of California (Re
gents), who own and operate the university; (3) Shirley G. Quan, a researcher employed by the Regents; (4) Genetics Institute, Inc.\~(Genetics Institute); and (5) Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [4] Moore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, shortly after he learned that he had hairy-cell leukemia. After hospitalizing Moore and \'93
withdr[awing] extensive amounts of blood, bone marrow aspirate, and other bodily substances,\'94 Golde confirmed that diagnosis. At this time all *126 defendants, including Golde, were aware that \'93
certain blood products and blood components were of great value in a number of commercial and scientific efforts\'94 and that access to a patient whose blood contained these substances would provide \'93competitive, commercial, and scientific advantages.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [5] On October 8, 1976, Golde recommended that Moore\rquote s spleen be removed. Golde informed Moore \'93that he had reason to fear for his life, and that the proposed splenectomy operation \'85 was
 necessary to slow down the progress of his disease.\'94 Based upon Golde\rquote s representations, Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the splenectomy.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [6] Before the operation, Golde and Quan \'93formed the intent and made arrangements to obtain portions of [Moore\rquote s] spleen following its removal\'94
 and to take them to a separate research unit. Golde gave written instructions to this effect on October 18 and 19, 1976. These research activities \'93were not intended to have \'85 any relation to [Moore\rquote s] medical \'85 care.\'94
 However, neither Golde nor Quan informed Moore of their plans to conduct this research or requested his permission. Surgeons at UCLA Medical Center, whom the complaint does not name as defendants, removed Moore\rquote s spleen on October 20, 1976.}{

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [7] Moore returned to the UCLA Medical Center several times between November 1976 and September 1983. He did so at Golde\rquote s direction and based upon representations \'93
that such visits were necessary and required for his health and well-being, and based upon the trust inherent in and by virtue of the physician-patient relationship\'85.\'94 On each of these visits Golde withdrew additional samples of \'93
blood, blood serum, skin, bone marrow aspirate, and sperm.\'94 On each occasion Moore travelled to the UCLA Medical Center from his home in Seattle because he had been told that the procedures were to be performed only there and only under Golde\rquote 
s direction.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [8] \'93In fact, [however,] throughout the period of time that [Moore] was under [Golde\rquote s] care and treatment, \'85 the defendants w
ere actively involved in a number of activities which they concealed from [Moore]\'85.\'94 Specifically, defendants were conducting research on Moore\rquote s cells and planned to \'93benefit financially and competitively \'85
 [by exploiting the cells] and [their] exclusive access to [the cells] by virtue of [Golde\rquote s] on-going physician-patient relationship\'85.\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [9] Sometime before August 1979, Golde established a cell line from Moore\rquote s T-lymphocytes. On January 30, 1981, the Regents applied for a patent on the cell line, listi
ng Golde and Quan as inventors. \'93[B]y virtue of an established policy \'85, [the] Regents, Golde, and Quan would share in any royalties or profits \'85 arising out of [the] patent.\'94
 The patent issued on March 20, 1984, naming Golde and Quan as the inventors of the cell line and the Regents as the assignee of the patent.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [10] The Regent\rquote s patent also covers various methods for using the cell line to produce lymphokines. Moore admits in his complaint that \'93the true clinical potential of each of the lymphokines 
\'85 [is] difficult to predict, [but] \'85
 competing commercial firms in these relevant fields have published reports in biotechnology industry periodicals predicting a potential market of approximately $3.01 Billion Dollars by the year 1990 for a whole range of [such lymphokines]\'85.\'94}{

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [11] With the Regents\rquote  assistance, Golde negotiated agreements for commercial development of the cell line and products to be derived from it. Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde \'93
became a paid consultant\'94 and \'93acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock.\'94 Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the Regents \'93at least $330,000 over three years, including a pro-rata share of [Golde\rquote 
s] salary and fringe benefits, in exchange for \'85 exclusive access to the materials and research performed\'94 on the cell line and products derived from it. On June 4, 1982, Sandoz \'93was added to the agreement,\'94

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [16] These principles lead to the following conclusions: (1) a physician must disclose personal interests unrelated to the patient\rquote 
s health, whether research or economic, that may affect the physician\rquote s professional judgment; and (2) a physician\rquote s failure to disclose such interests may give rise to a cause of action for performing medical procedures wi

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [17] To be sure, questions about the validity of a patient\rquote 
s consent to a procedure typically arise when the patient alleges that the physician failed to disclose medical risks, as in malpractice cases, a
nd not when the patient alleges that the physician had a personal interest, as in this case. The concept of informed consent, however, is broad enough to encompass the latter. \'93The scope of the physician\rquote s communication to the patient \'85
 must be measured by the patient\rquote s need, and that need is whatever information is material to the decision.\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [18] Indeed, the law already recognizes that a reasonable patient would want to know whether a physician has an economic interest that might affect the physician\rquote s pro
fessional judgment. As the Court of Appeal has said, \'93[c]ertainly a sick patient deserves to be free of any reasonable suspicion that his doctor\rquote s judgment is influenced by a profit motive.\'94
 (Magan Medical Clinic v. Cal. State Bd. of Medical Examiners* (19
67) 249 Cal.App.2d 124, 132, 57 Cal.Rptr. 256). The desire to protect patients from possible conflicts of interest has also motivated legislative enactments. Among these is Business and Professions Code section 654.2. Under that section, a physician may n
ot charge a patient on behalf of, or refer a patient to, any organization in which the physician has a \'93
significant beneficial interest, unless [the physician] first discloses in writing to the patient, that there is such an interest and advises the patient
 that the patient may choose any organization for the purposes of obtaining the services ordered or requested by [the physician].\'94(Bus. & Prof.Code, \'a7 654.2, subd. (a). See also Bus. & Prof.Code,\'a7
654.1 [referrals to clinical laboratories].) Similarly, under Health and Safety Code section 24173, a physician who plans to conduct a medical experiment on a patient must, among other things, inform the patient of \'93
[t]he name of the sponsor or funding source, if any, \'85 and the organization, if any, under whose general aegis the experiment is being conducted.\'94(Health & Saf.Code, \'a7 24173, subd. (c)(9).).}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [19] It is important to note that no law prohibits a physician from conducting research in the same area in which he practices. Progress in medicine often depends up
on physicians, such as those practicing at the university hospital where Moore received treatment, who conduct research while caring for their patients.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [20] Yet a physician who treats a patient in whom he also has a research interest has potentially confl
icting loyalties. This is because medical treatment decisions are made on the basis of proportionality\emdash weighing the benefits }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 to the patient}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157

nt are worth enduring for any individual patient depends upon the facts unique in each case,\'94 and \'93the patient\rquote s interests and desires are the key ingredients of the decision-making process.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

 195 Cal.Rptr. 484.) A physician who adds his own research interests to this balance may be tempted to order a scientifically useful procedure or test that offers marginal, or no, benefits to the patient. The possibility that an interest extraneous to the
 patient\rquote s health has affected the physician\rquote s judgment is something that a reasonable patient would want to know in deciding whether to consent to a proposed course of treatment. It is material to the patient\rquote

s medical interests have not been impaired. In that instance the argument is correct. On the other hand, a physician who does have a preexisting research i
nterest might, consciously or unconsciously, take that into consideration in recommending the procedure. In that instance the argument is incorrect: the physician\rquote s extraneous motivation may affect his judgment and is, thus, material to the patient

it is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to determine for himself the direction in which he believes his interests lie.\'94(}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Cobbs v. Grant}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

e of such allegations precludes Moore from stating a cause of action based upon the procedures undertaken on October 5, 1976. But, as already discussed, Moore clearly alleges that Golde had developed a research interest in his cells by October 20, 1976, w
hen the splenectomy was performed. Thus, Moore can state a cause of action based upon Golde\rquote s alleged failure to disclose that interest before the splenectomy.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781

tic materials and research involved in this case. Moore, adopting the analogy originally advanced by the Court of Appeal, argues that \'93[i]f the courts have found a sufficient proprietary interest in one\rquote

ystem. Moreover, the particular genetic material which is responsible for the natural production of lymphokines, and which defendants use to manufacture lymphokines in the laboratory, is also the same in every person; it is no more unique to Moore than th

[a] patient must have the ultimate power to control what becomes of his or her tissues. To hold otherwise would open the door to a massive invasion of human privacy and dignity in the name of medical progress.\'94
 Yet one may earnestly wish to protect privacy and dignity without accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those interests amounts to a conversion of personal property. Nor is it necessary to force the round pegs of \'93
privacy\'94 and \'93dignity\'94 into the square hole of \'93property\'94 in order to protect the patient, since the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories protect these interests directly by requiring full disclosure.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [45] The next consideration that makes Moore\rquote s claim of ownership problematic is California statutory law, which drastically limits a patient\rquote 
s control over excised cells. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 7054.4,\'93[n]otwithstanding any other provi
sion of law, recognizable anatomical parts, human tissues, anatomical human remains, or infectious waste following conclusion of scientific use shall be disposed of by interment, incineration, or any other method determined by the state department [of hea
lth services] to protect the public health and safety.\'94
Clearly the Legislature did not specifically intend this statute to resolve the question of whether a patient is entitled to compensation for the nonconsensual use of excised cells. A primary object of 
the statute is to ensure the safe handling of potentially hazardous biological waste materials. Yet one cannot escape the conclusion that the statute\rquote s practical effect is to limit, drastically, a patient\rquote 
s control over excised cells. By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to 
\'93property\'94 or \'93ownership\'94 for purposes of conversion law.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [46] It may be that some limited right to control the use of excised cells does survive the operation of this statute. There is, for example, no need to read the statute to permit \'93scientific use\'94
 contrary to the patient\rquote s expressed wish.A fully inform
ed patient may always withhold consent to treatment by a physician whose research plans the patient does not approve. That right, however, as already discussed, is protected by the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [49] There are three reasons why it is inappropriate to impose liability for conversion based upon the allegations of Moore\rquote s complaint. First, a fair balancing of 
the relevant policy considerations counsels against extending the tort. Second, problems in this area are better suited to legislative resolution. Third, the tort of conversion is not necessary to protect patients\rquote 
 rights. For these reasons, we conclude that the use of excised human cells in medical research does not amount to a conversion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [50] Of the relevant policy considerations, two are of overriding importance. The first is protection of a competent patient\rquote s right to make autonomous medical decisions
. That right, as already discussed, is grounded in well-recognized and long-standing principles of fiduciary duty and informed consent.(See, e.g., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Cobbs v. Grant}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

800, 176 P.2d 745.)This policy weighs in favor of providing a remedy to patients when physicians act with undisclosed motives that may affect their professional judgment. The second important policy consideration is that we not threaten w
ith disabling civil liability innocent parties who are engaged in socially useful activities, such as researchers who have no reason to believe that their use of a particular cell sample is, or may be, against a donor\rquote s wishes.}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [51] To reach an appropriate balance of these policy considerations is extremely important. In its report to Congress (see fn. 2, ante), the Office of Technology Assessment emphasized that \'93
[u]ncertainty about how courts will resolve disputes between specimen sources and specimen use
rs could be detrimental to both academic researchers and the infant biotechnology industry, particularly when the rights are asserted long after the specimen was obtained. The assertion of rights by sources would affect not only the researcher who obtaine
d the original specimen, but perhaps other researchers as well.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [52] \'93Biological materials are routinely distributed to other researchers for experimental purposes, and scientists who obtain cell lines or other specimen-derived products, such as gene clones
, from the original researcher could also be sued under certain legal theories [such as conversion]. Furthermore, the uncertainty could affect product developments as well as research. Since inventions containing human tissues and cells may be patented an
d licensed for commercial use, companies are unlikely to invest heavily in developing, manufacturing, or marketing a product when uncertainty about clear title exists.\'94 (OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{

search stemming from uncertainty about legal title to biological materials that the Office of Technology Assessment reached this striking conclusion: \'93
[R]egardless of the merit of claims by the different interested parties, resolving the current uncertainty may be more important to the future of biotechnology than resolving it in any particular way.\'94(OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [54] We need not, however, make an arbitrary choice between liability and nonliability. Instead, an examination of the relevant pol
icy considerations suggests an appropriate balance: Liability based upon existing disclosure obligations, rather than an unprecedented extension of the conversion theory, protects patients\rquote 
 rights of privacy and autonomy without unnecessarily hindering research.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [55] To be sure, the threat of liability for conversion might help to enforce patients\rquote  rights indirectly. This is because physicians might be able to avoid liability by obtaining patients\rquote 
 consent, in the broadest possible terms, to any conceivable
 subsequent research use of excised cells. Unfortunately, to extend the conversion theory would utterly sacrifice the other goal of protecting innocent parties. Since conversion is a strict liability tort,it would impose liability on all those into whose 
hands the cells come, whether or not the particular defendant participated in, or knew of, the inadequate disclosures that violated the patient\rquote 
s right to make an informed decision. In contrast to the conversion theory, the fiduciary-duty and informed-conse
nt theories protect the patient directly, without punishing innocent parties or creating disincentives to the conduct of socially beneficial research.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [56] Research on human cells plays a critical role in medical research. This is so because researchers ar
e increasingly able to isolate naturally occurring, medically useful biological substances and to produce useful quantities of such substances through genetic engineering. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Products developed through biotechnology
 
that have already been approved for marketing in this country include treatments and tests for leukemia, cancer, diabetes, dwarfism, hepatitis-B, kidney transplant rejection, emphysema, osteoporosis, ulcers, anemia, infertility, and gynecological tumors,

[57] The extension of conversion law into this area will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials. Thousands of human cell lines already exist in tissue repositories, such as the American Type Culture Collection and those 
operated by the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society. These repositories respond to tens of thousands of requests for samples annually. Since the patent office requires the holders of patents on cell lines to make samples availabl

49 percent of the researchers at medical institutions surveyed used human tissues or cells in their research.\'94 Many receive grants from the National Institute of Health for this work. (OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157

e standards. We wrote that, \'93
[i]f drug manufacturers were subject to strict liability, they might be reluctant to undertake research programs to develop some pharmaceuticals that would prove beneficial or to distribute others that are available to be marke

, the theory of liability that Moore urges us to endorse threatens to destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medi
cal research. If the use of cells in research is a conversion, then with every cell sample a researcher purchases a ticket in a litigation lottery. Because liability for conversion is predicated on a continuing ownership interest, \'93
companies are unlikely to invest heavily in developing, manufacturing, or marketing a product when uncertainty about clear title exists.\'94 (OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

 moral shortcomings, duplicity and greed. Let them be compelled, he argues, to disgorge a portion of their ill-gotten gains to the uninformed individual whose body was invaded and exploited and without whom such profits would not have been possible.}{

e

etting in which this case arises and the considerable interest this litigation has engendered within the medical research community and the public generally, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the specific allegations on which the complaint in this
 
case rests are quite unusual, setting this matter apart from the great majority of instances in which donated organs or cells provide the raw materials for the advancement of medical science and the development of new and beneficial medical products. Ordi
n
arily, when a patient consents to the use of a body part for scientific purposes, the potential value of the excised organ or cell is discovered only through subsequent experimentation or research, often months or years after the removal of the organ. In 
this case, however, the complaint alleges that plaintiff\rquote s doctor recognized the peculiar research and commercial value of plaintiff\rquote s cells before their removal from plaintiff\rquote 
s body. Despite this knowledge, the doctor allegedly failed to disclose these facts or his interest in the cells to plaintiff, either before plaintiff\rquote 
s initial surgery or throughout the ensuing seven-year period during which the doctor continued to obtain additional cells from plaintiff\rquote s body in the course of periodic medical examinations.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[75] The majority opinion, of course, is not oblivious to the significance of these unusual allegations. It relies on those allegations in concluding that the complaint states a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. I concur fully in that holding.

[76] When it turns to the conversion cause of action, however, the majority opinion fails to maintain its focus on the specific allegations before us. Concerned that the imposition of liability for conversion will impede medical research by innocen
t scientists who use the resources of existing cell repositories\emdash a factual setting not presented here\emdash 
the majority opinion rests its holding, that a conversion action cannot be maintained, largely on the proposition that a patient generally possesses no ri
ght in a body part that has already been removed from his body. Here, however, plaintiff has alleged that defendants interfered with his legal rights before his body part was removed. Although a patient may not retain any legal interest in a body part aft
e
r its removal when he has properly consented to its removal and use for scientific purposes, it is clear under California law that before a body part is removed it is the patient, rather than his doctor or hospital, who possesses the right to determine th
e use to which the body part will be put after removal. If, as alleged in this case, plaintiff\rquote s doctor improperly interfered with plaintiff\rquote 
s right to control the use of a body part by wrongfully withholding material information from him before its removal
, under traditional common law principles plaintiff may maintain a conversion action to recover the economic value of the right to control the use of his body part. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority opinion insofar as it rejects plaintiff\rquote

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [78] With respect to the additional defendants\emdash the Regents of the University of California (hereafter Regents), Shirley G. Quan, Genetics Institute, Inc.\~
(hereafter Genetics Institute) and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation (hereafter Sandoz)\emdash I cannot fully join in the majority\rquote s conclusion. Although I agree that the trial court erred in sustaining these defendants\rquote 
 demurrers to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action without leave to amend, in my view the majority\rquote s ruling with respect to these defendants is more equivocal than is warranted. (See maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

487 of 793 P.2d.) As the majority recognizes, the breach of fiduciary duty alleged in the complaint encompasses postoperative conduct\emdash 
for example, the periodic withdrawal of blood, blood serum, bone marrow aspirate and sperm samples from plaintiff, requiring plaintiff to travel from Seattle to the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles (hereafter UCLA Medical C
enter)\emdash which continued until September 1983. By that date, according to the complaint, all of the defendants, including Genetics Institute and Sandoz, were already involved in the commercial venture. Despite the \'93boilerplate\'94
 nature of some of the agency allegations in the complaint (see maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~153, fn. 12 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
486, fn. 12 of 793 P.2d), the complaint\rquote s allegations, viewed in their entirety,charge sufficient complicity on the part of all defendants in the allegedly improper posto
perative conduct to survive a demurrer. If, after discovery, it becomes clear that the additional defendants bear no responsibility for either the original or continuing breach of fiduciary duty, those defendants can, of course, move for summary judgment 
on this count. At the present pleading stage, however, it is premature to absolve any of the defendants of liability for breach of fiduciary duty.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [79] I disagree, however, with the suggestion in the dissenting opinion that defendants will be able to avoid 
all liability under the breach-of-fiduciary-duty theory simply by showing that plaintiff would have proceeded with the surgical removal of his diseased spleen even if defendants had disclosed their research and commercial interest in his cells. (See dis. 
opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 post}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~186\endash 187 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~519\endash 
520 of 793 P.2d.) In the first place, because the alleged breach of fiduciary duty encompasses the postoperative conduct of defendants as well as the presurgical failure to disclose, plaintiff will clearly b
e entitled to recover under a breach-of-fiduciary-duty theory by establishing that he would not have consented to some or all of the extensive postoperative medical procedures if he had been fully aware of defendants\rquote 
 research and economic interests and motivations. Second, and more generally, in this context\emdash unlike in the traditional \'93informed consent\'94 context of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Cobbs v. Grant}{\rtlch\fcs1

ify in advance of trial the various kinds of damage or injury for which plaintiff may properly recover in his breach-of-fiduciary-duty action, and that may be understandable. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that, in appropriate circumstances, punitive as 
well as compensatory damages would clearly be recoverable in such an action. Accordingly, the dissent underestimates the potential efficacy of the breach-of-fiduciary-duty cause of action in dismissing the action as a \'93paper tiger.\'94 (Dis. opn., }{

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[82] In analyzing the conversion issue, the majority properly begins with the established requirements of a common law conversion action, explaining that a plaintiff is required to demonstrate an actual interference with his \'93ownership or right of 
possession\'94 in the property in question. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~155 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
488 of 793 P.2d.) Although the majority opinion, at several points, appears to suggest that a removed body part, by its nature, may never constitute \'93property\'94 for purposes of a conversion action (see maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~156, 157, 158 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~
489, 490, 491 of 793 P.2d), there is no reason to think that the majority opinion actually intends to embrace such a broad or dubious proposition. If, for example, ano
ther medical center or drug company had stolen all of the cells in question from the UCLA Medical Center laboratory and had used them for its own benefit, there would be no question but that a cause of action for conversion would properly lie against the 
thief, and the majority opinion does not suggest otherwise. Thus, the majority\rquote s analysis cannot rest on the broad proposition that a removed body part is not property, but rather rests on the proposition that a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 patient}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  retains no ownership interest in a body part once the body part has been removed from his or her body.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [83] The majority opinion fails to recognize, however, that, in light of the allegations of the present complaint, the pertinent inquiry is not whether a patient generally retains an ownersh
ip interest in a body part after its removal from his body, but rather whether a patient has a right to determine, before a body part is removed, the use to which the part will be put after removal. Although the majority opinion suggests that there are 
\'93reasons to doubt\'94 that a patient retains \'93any\'94 ownership interest in his organs or cells after removal (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~
155 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~488 of 793 P.2d), the opinion fails to identify any statutory provision or common law authority that indicate
s that a patient does not generally have the right, before a body part is removed, to choose among the permissible uses to which the part may be put after removal. On the contrary, the most closely related statutory scheme\emdash 
the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (Health & Saf.Code, \'a7 7150 et seq.) \emdash makes it quite clear that a patient does have this right.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [84] The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act is a comprehensive statutory scheme that was initially adopted in California in 1970 and most recently revised in 1988. Altho
ugh that legislation, by its terms, applies only to a donation of all or part of a human body which is \'93to take effect upon or after [the] death [of the donor]\'94 (\'a7 7150.1, subd. (a))\emdash 
and thus is not directly applicable to the present case which involves a living donor\emdash the act is nonetheless instructive with regard to this state\rquote s general policy concerning an individual\rquote 
s authority to control the use of a donated body part. The act, which authorizes an anatomical gift to be made, inter alia, to \'93[a] hospital [or a] physician [,] \'85
 for transplantation, therapy, medical or dental education, research or advancement of medical or dental science\'94 (\'a7 7153, subd. (a)(1)), expressly provides that such a gift \'93may be made to a designated donee or without designating a donee\'94 (
\'a7 7153, subd. (b)) and also that the donor may make such a gift \'93for any of the purposes [specified in the statute or may] limit an anatomical gift to one or more of those purposes\'85.\'94 (\'a7
 7150.5, subd. (a).) Thus, the act clearly recognizes that it
 is the donor of the body part, rather than the hospital or physician who receives the part, who has the authority to designate, within the parameters of the statutorily authorized uses, the particular use to which the part may be put.}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [85] Although, as noted, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act applies only to anatomical gifts that take effect on or after the death of the donor, the general principle of \'93donor control\'94
 which the act embodies is clearly not limited to that setting. In the transplantation context, for example, it is common for a living donor to designate the specific donee\emdash often a relative\emdash 
who is to receive a donated organ. If a hospital, after removing an organ from such a donor, decided on its own to give the organ to a different donee, no one 
would deny that the hospital had violated the legal right of the donor by its unauthorized use of the donated organ. Accordingly, it is clear under California law that a patient has the right, prior to the removal of an organ, to control the use to which 
the organ will be put after removal.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[86] It is also clear, under traditional common law principles, that this right of a patient to control the future use of his organ is protected by the law of conversion. As a general matter, the tort of conversion prote
cts an individual not only against improper interference with the right of possession of his property but also against unauthorized use of his property or improper interference with his right to control the use of his property. Sections 227 and 228 of the
 Restatement Second of Torts specifically provide in this regard that \'93[o]ne who uses a chattel in a manner which is a serious violation of the right of another to control its use is subject to liability to the other for conversion\'94 and that \'93
[o]ne who is authorized to make a particular use of a chattel, and uses it in a manner exceeding the authorization, is subject to liability for conversion to another whose right to control the use of the chattel is thereby seriously violated.\'94
 California cases have also long recognized that \'93unauthorized use\'94 of property can give rise to a conversion action. (See }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Hollywood M.P. Equipment Co.\~v. Furer }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507

[87] The application of these principles to the present case is evident. If defendants had informed plaintiff, prior to removal, of the possible uses to which his body part could be put and plaintiff had authorized one particular use, it is clear under t
he foregoing authorities that defendants would be liable for conversion if they disregarded plaintiff\rquote 
s decision and used the body part in an unauthorized manner for their own economic benefit. Although in this case defendants did not disregard a specific 
directive from plaintiff with regard to the future use of his body part, the complaint alleges that, before the body part was removed, defendants intentionally withheld material information that they were under an obligation to disclose to plaintiff and t
h
at was necessary for his exercise of control over the body part; the complaint also alleges that defendants withheld such information in order to appropriate the control over the future use of such body part for their own economic benefit. If these allega
tions are true, defendants clearly improperly interfered with plaintiff\rquote s right in his body part at a time when he had the authority to determine the future use of such part, thereby misappropriating plaintiff\rquote 
s right of control for their own advantage. Under these circumstances, the complaint fully satisfies the established requirements of a conversion cause of action.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [88] As already noted, the majority maintains that there are a number of \'93reasons to doubt\'94 that a patient retains any legally protectable interest in his organs after removal (maj. opn., }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~489 of 793 P.2d), but none of these reasons withstands scrutiny. The majority first relies on the fact that \'93
no reported judicial decision supports Moore\rquote s claim, either directly or by close analogy.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.
\~489 of 793 P.2d.) By the same token, however, there is no reported judicial decision that rejects such a claim. This is simply a case of first impression. And while the majority goes on to emphasize that it is the \'93specialized statutes\'94
 dealing with human biological materials to which the court should look for guidance in determining whether a patient has any legal rights with respect to an organ after removal (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~489 of 793 P.2d), the majority fails to recognize that the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, as we have seen, expressly confirms a patient\rquote 
s right to designate, prior to removal, the use to which a body part will be put. (See }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~168\endash 169 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~501\endash

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [89] The majority next relies on the provisions of section 7054.4, a statute that addresses the potential health hazards posed by the improper disposal of human body parts, reasoning that this statute 
\'93drastically limits a patient\rquote s control over excised cells.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~158 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
491 of 793 P.2d.) While I agree with the majority that section 7054.4 should reasonably be interpreted to apply to body parts removed from a living patient 
as well as from dead bodies, the statute nonetheless provides absolutely no support for the majority\rquote s conclusion. Although section 7054.4 limits a patient\rquote 
s control over an excised body part in the sense that it prohibits him from taking the removed part 
to his home and keeping it on his mantel, the statute certainly does not suggest that a patient does not have the right to choose among the legally permissible uses of his organ. Similarly, there is nothing in section 7054.4 which indicates that a doctor 
or medical facility that removes a patient\rquote 
s organ possesses any greater right than the patient himself to choose the further use to which the removed organ will be put. Since the majority does not suggest that the provisions of section 7054.4 should be int
erpreted to prohibit the research or commercial activities at issue in this case\emdash and I agree that the statute cannot reasonably be interpreted to prohibit such use\emdash 
I cannot understand how section 7054.4 provides any assistance to the majority\rquote s argument.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [90] Finally, the majority maintains that plaintiff\rquote s conversion action is not viable because \'93the subject matter of the Regents\rquote  patent\emdash 
the patented cell line and the products derived from it\emdash cannot be Moore\rquote s property.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.
\~492 of 793 P.2d.) Even if this is an accurate statement of federal patent law, it does not explain why plaintiff may not maintain a conversion action for defendants\rquote  unauthorized use of his own body parts, blood, blood serum, bone marrow, and sp
erm. Although the damages which plaintiff may recover in a conversion action may not include the value of the patent and the derivative products, the fact that plaintiff may not be entitled to all of the damages which his complaint seeks does not justify 
denying his right to maintain any conversion action at all. Similarly, although the question whether plaintiff\rquote s cells are \'93unique\'94
 may well affect the amount of damages plaintiff will be able to recover in a conversion action, the question of uniqueness has no proper bearing on plaintiff\rquote 
s basic right to maintain a conversion action; ordinary property, as well as unique property, is, of course, protected against conversion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [92] Although the majority opinion does not acknowledge that plaintiff\rquote s conversion action is supported by existing common law principles, its reasoning suggests that the majori

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [93] One of the majority\rquote s principal policy concerns is that \'93[t]he extension of conversion law into this area will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials\'94\emdash 
the thousands of cell lines and tissues already in cell and tissue repositories. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~161 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~494 of 793
 P.2d.) The majority suggests that the \'93exchange of scientific materials, which still is relatively free and efficient, will surely be compromised if each cell sample becomes the potential subject matter of a lawsuit.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~495 of 793 P.2d.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [94] This policy argument is flawed in a number of respects. First, the majority\rquote 
s stated concern does not provide any justification for barring plaintiff from bringing a conversion action against a party who does not obtain organs or cells from a cell bank but who directly interferes with or misappropriates a patient\rquote 
s right to control the use of his organs or cells. Although the majority opinion suggests that the availability of a breach-of-fiduciary-duty cause of action obviates any need for a conversion action against this category of defendants (see maj. opn., }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~163\endash 164 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~496\endash 
497 of 793 P.2d), the existence of a breach-of-fiduciary-duty cause of action does not provide a complete answer. Even if in 
this case plaintiff may obtain the same remedy against such defendants under a breach-of-fiduciary-duty theory as he could under a conversion cause of action, in other factual settings an unlawful interference with a patient\rquote 
s right to control the use of h
is body part may occur in the absence of a breach of fiduciary duty. For example, if a patient donated his removed cells to a medical center, reserving the right to approve or disapprove the research projects for which the cells would be used, and if anot
h
er medical center or a drug manufacturer stole the cells after removal and used them in an unauthorized manner for its own economic gain, no breach-of-fiduciary-duty cause of action would be available and a conversion action would be necessary to vindicat
e the patient\rquote s rights. Under the majority\rquote 
s holding, however, the patient would have no right to bring a conversion action, even against such a thief. As this hypothetical illustrates, even if there were compelling policy reasons to limit the potential lia
bility of innocent researchers who use cells obtained from an existing cell bank, those policy considerations would not justify the majority\rquote s broad abrogation of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 all}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  conversion liability for the unauthorized use of body parts.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [95] Second, even with respect to those persons who are not involved in the initial conversion, the majority\rquote s policy arguments are less than compelling. To begin with, the majority\rquote 
s fear that the availability of a conversion remedy will restrict access to existing cell lines is unrealistic. In the vast majority of instances the tissues and cells in existing repositories will }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 
not}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  represent a potential source of liability because they will have come from patients who consented to their organ\rquote s use for scien
tific purposes under circumstances in which such consent was not tainted by a failure to disclose the known valuable nature of the cells. Because potential liability under a conversion theory will exist in only the exceedingly rare instance in which a doc
tor knowingly concealed from the patient the value of his body part or the patient\rquote 
s specific directive with regard to the use of the body part was disregarded, there is no reason to think that application of settled conversion law will have any negative effect on the primary conduct of medical researchers who use tissue and cell banks.
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [96] Furthermore, even in the rare instance\emdash like the present case\emdash in which a conversion action might be successfully pursued, the potential liability is not likely \'93to destro
y the economic incentive to conduct important medical research,\'94 as the majority asserts. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
495 of 793 P.2d.)If, as the majority suggests, the great bulk of the value of a cell line patent and derivative products is attributable to the efforts of medical researchers and drug companies, rather than to the \'93raw materials\'94
 taken from a patient (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~159\endash 160of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~492\endash 493 of 793 P.2d),the patient\rquote 
s damages will be correspondingly limited, and innocent medical researchers and drug manufacturers will retain the considerable economic benefits resulting from their own work. Under established conversion law, a \'93subsequent innocent converter\'94
 does not forfeit the proceeds of his own creative efforts, but rather \'93is entitled to the benefit of any work or labor that he has expended on the [property]\'85.\'94 (1 Harper et al., The Law of Torts (2d ed.\~1986) \'a7 2.34, p.\~

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [97] Finally, the majority\rquote s anal
ysis of the relevant policy considerations tellingly omits a most pertinent consideration. In identifying the interests of the patient that are implicated by the decision whether to recognize a conversion cause of action, the opinion speaks only of the 
\'93patient\rquote s right to make autonomous medical decisions\'94 (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~160 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
493 of 793 P.2d) and fails even to mention the patient\rquote s interest in obtaining the economic value, if any, that may adhere in the subsequent use of his own body parts. Although such economic value may constitute a fortuitous \'93windfall\'94
 to the patient (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
496 of 793 P.2d),the fortuitous nature of the economic value does not justify the creation of a novel exception from conversion liability which sanctions the intentional misappropriation of that value from the patient.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [98] This last point reveals perhaps the most serious flaw in the majority\rquote s public policy analysis in this case. It is certainly arguable that, as a matt
er of policy or morality, it would be wiser to prohibit any private individual or entity from profiting from the fortuitous value that adheres in a part of a human body, and instead to require all valuable excised body parts to be deposited in a public re
p
ository which would make such materials freely available to all scientists for the betterment of society as a whole. The Legislature, if it wished, could create such a system, as it has done with respect to organs that are donated for transplantation. (Se
e \'a7 7155, subd. (a); Pen.Code, \'a7 367f. See also 42 U.S.C. \'a7
 274e.) To date, however, the Legislature has not adopted such a system for organs that are to be used for research or commercial purposes, and the majority opinion, despite some oblique suggestions to the contrary (see maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~161\endash 162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~494\endash 495 of 793 P.2d), emphatically does not do so by its holding in this case. Justice Arabian\rquote 
s concurring opinion suggests that the majority\rquote s conclusion is informed by the precept that it is immoral to sell human body parts for profit. (See conc. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~165\endash 166 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~498\endash 499 of 793 P.2d.) But the majority\rquote s rejection of plaintiff\rquote s conversion cause of action does not mean that body parts may not be bought or
 sold for research or commercial purposes or that no private individual or entity may benefit economically from the fortuitous value of plaintiff\rquote s diseased cells. Far from elevating these biological materials above the marketplace, the majority

 in his cells after they were removed from his body. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~489
 of 793 P.2d.) To state a conversion cause of action a plaintiff must allege his \'93ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157

 to include inter alia his blood, his bodily tissues, his cells, and the cell lines derived therefrom. Moore thereafter alleges that \'93he is the owner of his Blood and Bodily Substances and of the by-products produced therefrom\'85.\'94
 And he further alleges that such blood and bodily substances \'93are his tangible personal property, and the activities of the defendants as set forth herein constitute a substantial interference with plaintiff\rquote s possession

 that Moore retained a sufficient ownership interest in his cells, after their excision, to support a conversion cause of action. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157

gain when a new rule was needed we did not stay our hand merely because the matter was one of first impression. For example, in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

 that could not have been foreseen when traditional tort doctrine here, the law of conversion\emdash was formulated. My point is that if the cause of action for conversion is otherwise an appropriate remedy on these facts, we should not 
refrain from fashioning it simply because another court has not yet so held or because the Legislature has not yet addressed the question. We need not wait on either event, because neither is a precondition to an exercise of our long-standing \'93

Code section 7054.4 (hereafter section 7054.4),set forth in the margin.The majority concede that the statute was not meant to directly resolve the question whether a person in Moore\rquote

By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to \lquote property\rquote  or

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [110] First, in my view the statute does not authorize the principal use that defendants claim the right to make of Moore\rquote 
s tissue, i.e., its commercial exploitation. In construing section 7054.4, of course, \'93we look first to the words of the statute themselves\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [111] By its terms, section 7054.4 permits only \'93scientific use\'94 of excised body parts and tissue before they must be destroyed. We must therefore determine the usual
 and ordinary meaning of that phrase. I would agree that \'93scientific use\'94
 at least includes routine postoperative examination of excised tissue conducted by a pathologist for diagnostic or prognostic reasons (e.g., to verify preoperative diagnosis or to as
sist in determining postoperative treatment). I might further agree that \'93scientific use\'94 could be extended to include purely scientific study of the tissue by a disinterested researcher for the purpose of advancing medical knowledge\emdash 
provided of course tha
t the patient gave timely and informed consent to that use. It would stretch the English language beyond recognition, however, to say that commercial exploitation of the kind and degree alleged here is also a usual and ordinary meaning of the phrase \'93
scientific use.\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [112] The majority dismiss this difficulty by asserting that I read the statute to define \'93scientific use\'94 as \'93not-for-profit scientific use,\'94 and by finding \'93
no reason to believe that the Legislature intended to make such a distinction.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~159, fn. 34 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
492, fn. 34 of 793 P.2d.) The objection misses my point. I do not stress the concept of profit, but the concept of science: the distinction I draw is not between nonprofit scientific use and scientific use t
hat happens to lead to a marketable by-product; it is between a truly }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 scientific}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  use and the blatant }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid4943157 commercial}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  exploitation of Moore\rquote s tissue that the present complaint alleges. Under those allegations, defendants Dr.\~David W. Golde and Shirley G. Quan we
re not only scientists, they were also full-fledged entrepreneurs: the complaint repeatedly declares that they appropriated Moore\rquote s tissue in order \'93to further defendants\rquote 
 independent research and commercial activities and promote their economic, financial and competitive interests.\'94
 The complaint also alleges that defendant Regents of the University of California (hereafter Regents) actively assisted the individual defendants in applying for patent rights and in negotiating with bioengineering and pharmace
utical companies to exploit the commercial potential of Moore\rquote 
s tissue. Finally, the complaint alleges in detail the contractual arrangements between the foregoing defendants and defendants Genetics Institute, Inc., and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 
giving the latter companies exclusive rights to exploit that commercial potential while providing substantial financial benefits to the individual defendants in the form of cash, stock options, consulting fees, and fringe benefits. To exclude such traditi
onally commercial activities from the phrase \'93scientific use,\'94 as I do here, does not give it a restrictive definition; rather, it gives the phrase its usual and ordinary meaning, as settled law requires.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [113] Secondly, even if section 7054.4 does permit defendants\rquote  commercial exploitation of Moore\rquote s tissue under the guise of \'93scientific use,\'94 it does not follow that\emdash 
as the majority conclude\emdash the statute \'93eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property\'94 that what remains does not amount to \'93property\'94 or \'93ownership\'94 for purposes of the law of conversion. (Maj. opn., }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~492 of 793 P.2d.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [114] The concepts of property and ownership in our law are extremely broad. (See Civ.Code, \'a7\'a7 654, 655.) A leading decision of this court approved the following definition: \'93 \lquote The term 
\'93property\'94 is sufficiently comprehensive to include every species of estate, real and personal, and everything which one person can own and transfer to another. It extends to every species of right 
and interest capable of being enjoyed as such upon which it is practicable to place a money value.\rquote  \'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Yuba River Power Co.\~v. Nevada Irr. Dist.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157  (1929) 207 Cal. 521, 523, 279 P. 128.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [115] Being broad, the concept of property is also abstract: rather than
 referring directly to a material object such as a parcel of land or the tractor that cultivates it, the concept of property is often said to refer to a \'93bundle of rights\'94 that may be exercised with respect to that object\emdash 
principally the rights to possess the property, to use the property, to exclude others from the property, and to dispose of the property by sale or by gift. \'93
Ownership is not a single concrete entity but a bundle of rights and privileges as well as of obligations.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Union Oil Co.\~v. State Bd. of Equal.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157 
 (1963) 60 Cal.2d 441, 447, 34 Cal.Rptr. 872, 386 P.2d 496.) But the same bundle of rights does not attach to all forms of property. For a variety of policy reasons, the law limits or even forbids the exercise of certain rights over certain fo
rms of property. For example, both law and contract may limit the right of an owner of real property to use his parcel as he sees fit.Owners of various forms of personal property may likewise be subject to restrictions on the time, place, and manner of th
e
ir use.Limitations on the disposition of real property, while less common, may also be imposed. Finally, some types of personal property may be sold but not given away, while others may be given away but not sold, and still others may neither be given awa
y nor sold.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[116] In each of the foregoing instances, the limitation or prohibition diminishes the bundle of rights that would otherwise attach to the property, yet what remains is still deemed in law to be a protectable property interest. \'93Since property o
r title is a complex bundle of rights, duties, powers and immunities, the pruning away of some or a great many of these elements does not entirely destroy the title\'85.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 People v. Walker}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  (1939) 33 Cal.App.2d 18, 20, 90 P.2d 854 [even the possessor of contraband has certain property rights in it against anyone other than the state].) The same rule applies to Moore\rquote 
s interest in his own body tissue: even if we assume that section 7054.4 limited the use and disposition of his excised tissue in the manner claime
d by the majority, Moore nevertheless retained valuable rights in that tissue. Above all, at the time of its excision he at least had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 
the right to do with his own tissue whatever the defendants did with it}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 : i.e., he could have contracted with researchers a
nd pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the vast commercial potential of his tissue and its products. Defendants certainly believe that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 their}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157  right to do the foregoing is not barred by section 7054.4 and is a significant property right, as they 
have demonstrated by their deliberate concealment from Moore of the true value of his tissue, their efforts to obtain a patent on the Mo cell line, their contractual agreements to exploit this material, their exclusion of Moore from any participation in t
he profits, and their vigorous defense of this lawsuit. The Court of Appeal summed up the point by observing that \'93Defendants\rquote  position that plaintiff cannot own his tissue, but that they can, is fraught with irony.\'94
 It is also legally untenable. As noted above, the majority cite no case holding that an individual\rquote s right to develop and exploit the commercial potential of his own tissue is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 not}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  a right of sufficient worth or dignity to be deemed a protectable property interest. In the absence of such authority\emdash or of legislation to the same effect\emdash 
the right falls within the traditionally broad concept of property in our law.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [117] The majority\rquote s third and last reason for their conclusion that Moore has no cause of action for conversion under existing law is that \'93the subject matter of the Regents\rquote  patent
\emdash the patented cell line and the products derived from it\emdash cannot be Moore\rquote s property.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~
159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~492 of 793 P.2d.) The majority then offer a dual explanation: \'93This is because the patented cell line is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 factually and legally}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157  distinct from the cells taken from Moore\rquote s body.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Ibid.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
, italics added.) Neither branch of the explanation withstands analysis.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [118] First, in support of their statement that the Mo cell line is \'93factually distinct\'94 from Moore\rquote s cells, the majority assert that \'93
Cells change while being developed into a cell line and continue to change over time,\'94 and in particular may acquire an abnormal number of chromosomes. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~159, fn. 35 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~492, fn. 35 of 793 P.2d.) No one disputes these assertions, but they are nonetheless irrelevant. For present purposes no distinction can be drawn between Moore\rquote 
s cells and the Mo cell line. It appears that the principal reason for establishing a cell line is not to \'93improve\'94
 the quality of the parent cells but simply to extend their life indefinitely, in order to permit long-term study and/or exploitation of the qualities already present in such cells. The complaint alleges that Moore\rquote s cells naturally
 produced certain valuable proteins in larger than normal quantities; indeed, that was why defendants were eager to culture them in the first place. Defendants do not claim that the cells of the Mo cell line are in any degree more productive of such prote
ins than were Moore\rquote 
s own cells. Even if the cells of the Mo cell line in fact have an abnormal number of chromosomes, at the present stage of this case we do not know if that fact has any bearing whatever on their capacity to produce proteins; yet it is in
 the commercial exploitation of that capacity\emdash not simply in their number of chromosomes\emdash that Moore seeks to assert an interest. For all that appears, therefore, the emphasized fact is a distinction without a difference.}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [119] Second, the majority assert in effect that Moore cannot have an ownership interest in the Mo cell line because defendants patented it. The majority\rquote s point wholly fails to meet Moore\rquote 
s claim that he is entitled to compensation for defendants\rquote  unauthorized use of his bodily tissues }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 before}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
 defendants patented the Mo cell line: defendants undertook such use immediately after the splenectomy on October 20, 1976, and continued to extract and use Moore\rquote 
s cells and tissue at least until September 20, 1983; the patent, however, did not issue un
til March 20, 1984, more than seven years after the unauthorized use began. Whatever the legal consequences of that event, it did not operate retroactively to immunize defendants from accountability for conduct occurring long before the patent was granted
.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[120] Nor did the issuance of the patent in 1984 necessarily have the drastic effect that the majority contend. To be sure, the patent granted defendants the exclusive right to make, use, or sell the invention for a period of 17 years.(35 U.S.C. \'a7
 154.) Bu
t Moore does not assert any such right for himself. Rather, he seeks to show that he is entitled, in fairness and equity, to some share in the profits that defendants have made and will make from their commercial exploitation of the Mo cell line. I do not
 question that the cell line is primarily the product of defendants\rquote  inventive effort. Yet likewise no one can question Moore\rquote s crucial contribution to the invention\emdash 
an invention named, ironically, after him: but for the cells of Moore\rquote s body taken by defendants, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 there would have been no Mo cell line}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
. Thus the complaint alleges that Moore\rquote s \'93Blood and Bodily Substances were absolutely essential to defendants\rquote  research and commercial activities with regard to his cells, cell lines, [and] the Mo cell-line, \'85 a
nd that defendants could not have applied for and had issued to them the Mo cell-line patent and other patents described herein without obtaining and culturing specimens of plaintiff\rquote s Blood and Bodily Substances.\'94
 Defendants admit this allegation by their demurrers, as well they should: for all their expertise, defendants do not claim they could have extracted the Mo cell line out of thin air.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [121] Nevertheless the majority conclude that the patent somehow cut off all Moore\rquote s rights\emdash past, present, and future\emdash to share in the proceeds of defendants\rquote 
 commercial exploitation of the cell line derived from his own body tissue. The majority cite no authority for this unfair result, and I cannot believe it is compelled by the general law of patents: a patent is no
t a license to defraud.Perhaps the answer lies in an analogy to the concept of \'93joint inventor.\'94 I am aware that \'93patients and research subjects who contribute cells to research will not be considered inventors.\'94 (OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , at p.\~71.) Nor is such a person strictly speaking a \'93joint inventor\'94 within the meaning of the term in federal law.(35 U.S.C. \'a7
 116.) But he does fall within the spirit of that law: \'93The joint invention provision guarantees that all who contribute in a substantial way to a product\rquote 
s development benefit from the reward that the product brings. Thus, the protection of joint inventors encourages scientists to cooperate with each other and ensures that each contributor is rewarded fairly.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [122] \'93Although a patient who donates cells doe
s not fit squarely within the definition of a joint inventor, the policy reasons that inform joint inventor patents should also apply to cell donors. Neither John Moore nor any other patient whose cells become the basis for a patentable cell line qualifie
s as a \lquote joint inventor\rquote 
 because he or she did not further the development of the product in any intellectual or conceptual sense. Nor does the status of patients as sole owners of a component part make them deserving of joint inventorship status. What the p
atients did do, knowingly or unknowingly, is collaborate with the researchers by donating their body tissue\'85

t role in the progress of medicine, and that the manipulation of those cells by the methods of biotechnology has resulted in numerous beneficial products and treatments. Yet it does not necessarily follow that, as the majority claim, application of the la
w of conversion to this area \'93will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials,\'94 i.e., to cells, cell cultures, and cell lines. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507

This exchange of scientific materials, which still is relatively free and efficient, will surely be compromised if each cell sample becomes the potential subject matter of a lawsuit.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157

 it is much less so today. Since biological products of genetic engineering became patentable in 1980 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Diamond v. Chakrabarty}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
 1980) 447 U.S. 303, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144), human cell lines have been amenable to patent protection and, as the Court of Appeal observed in its opinion below, \'93The rush to patent for exclusive use has been rampant.\'94
 Among those who have taken advantage of this development, of course, are the defendants herein: as we have seen, defendan
ts Golde and Quan obtained a patent on the Mo cell line in 1984 and assigned it to defendant Regents. With such patentability has come a drastic reduction in the formerly free access of researchers to new cell lines and their products: the \'93novelty\'94
 requirement for patentability prohibits public disclosure of the invention at all times up to one year before the filing of the patent application.(35 U.S.C. \'a7 102(b).)Thus defendants herein recited in their patent specification, \'93
At no time has the Mo cell line
 been available to other than the investigators involved with its initial discovery and only the conditioned medium from the cell line has been made available to a limited number of investigators for collaborative work with the original discoverers of the
 Mo cell line.\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[129] An even greater force for restricting the free exchange of new cell lines and their products has been the rise of the biotechnology industry and the increasing involvement of academic researchers in that industry. When scientists becam
e entrepreneurs and negotiated with biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the commercial potential of their discoveries\emdash as did defendants in the case at bar\emdash 
layers of contractual restrictions were added to the protections of the patent law.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [130] In their turn, the biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies demanded and received exclusive rights in the scientists\rquote 
 discoveries, and frequently placed those discoveries under trade secret protection. Trade secret protection is 
popular among biotechnology companies because, among other reasons, the invention need not meet the strict standards of patentability and the protection is both quickly acquired and unlimited in duration. (Note, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

219.) Secrecy as a normal business practice is also taking hold in university research laboratories, often because of industry pressure (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 id.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  at pp.

 e.g., for purely research purposes, it does not follow that the researcher who obtains such material must necessarily remain ignorant of any limitations on its use: by means of appropriate record keeping, the researcher can be assured that the source of 
the material has consented to his proposed use of it, and hence that such use is not a conversion. To achieve this end the originator of the tissue sample first determines the extent of the source\rquote s informed consent to its use\emdash 
 e.g., for research only, or f
or public but academic use, or for specific or general commercial purposes; he then enters this information in the record of the tissue sample, and the record accompanies the sample into the hands of any researcher who thereafter undertakes to work with i
t. \'93
Record keeping would not be overly burdensome because researchers generally keep accurate records of tissue sources for other reasons: to trace anomalies to the medical history of the patient, to maintain title for other researchers and for themselves, 
and to insure reproducibility of the experiment.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Toward the Right of Commerciality}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157

),but the case is plainly distinguishable. In a unanimous opinion that I authored for the court, we considered inter alia whether pharmaceutical manufacturers should be held strictly liable for injuries caused by \'93defectively designed\'94
 prescription drugs. We declined to so hold for several policy reasons.(}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Id.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  at pp.\~1063\endash 1065, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 
P.2d 470.) One of those reasons was our concern that \'93the fear of large adverse monetary judgments\'94 might dissuade such manufacturers from developing or distributing potentially beneficial new drugs. (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  and the case at bar, but the analogy fails because liability exposure in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Brown}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157

users from prescription drugs is unavoidable.\'94
(Ibid., italics added.) On an industry-wide basis, therefore, the imposition of strict liability for defective prescription drugs would inevitably result in hundreds, if not thousands, of meritorious claims by 
often seriously harmed plaintiffs, most of them likely to be seeking exemplary as well as compensatory damages. Given the innocence and vulnerability of the typical plaintiff in such cases, sympathetic juries might well return substantial verdicts again a
nd again, and the industry\rquote s total liability could reach intimidating proportions. Indeed, in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Brown}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157

 to conduct the type of research here in issue (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
495 of 793 P.2d), but it is difficult to take this hyperbole seriously. First, the majority reason that with every cell sample a researcher \'93purchases a ticket in a litigation lottery.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Id.}{

496 of 793 P.2d.)This is a colorful image, but it does not necessarily reflect reality: as explained above, with proper record keeping the researcher acquires not a litigation-lottery ticket but the information he needs precisely in order to avoid litig
ation. In contrast to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Brown}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 ,therefore, here the harm is by no means \'93unavoidable.\'94
 Second, the risk at hand is not of a multiplicity of actions: in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Brown}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  the harm would be suffered by many members of the public\emdash 
the users of the end product of the process of developing the new drug\emdash while here it can be suffered by only one person\emdash 
the original source of the research material that began that process. Third, the harm to the latter will be primarily economic, rather than the potentially grave physical injuries at issue in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Brown}{

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [134] In any event, in my view whatever merit the majority\rquote 
s single policy consideration may have is outweighed by two contrary considerations, i.e., policies that are promoted by recognizing that every individual has a legally protectabl
e property interest in his own body and its products. First, our society acknowledges a profound ethical imperative to respect the human body as the physical and temporal expression of the unique human persona. One manifestation of that respect is our pro
h
ibition against direct abuse of the body by torture or other forms of cruel or unusual punishment. Another is our prohibition against indirect abuse of the body by its economic exploitation for the sole benefit of another person. The most abhorrent form o
f such exploitation, of course, was the institution of slavery. Lesser forms, such as indentured servitude or even debtor\rquote s prison, have also disappeared. Yet their specter haunts the laboratories and boardrooms of today\rquote 
s biotechnological research-industrial complex. It arises wherever scientists or industrialists claim, as defendants claim here, the right to appropriate and exploit a patient\rquote s tissue for their sole economic benefit \emdash 
the right, in other words, to freely mine or harvest valuable physical properties of the patient\rquote s body: \'93
Research with human cells that results in significant economic gain for the researcher and no gain for the patient offends the traditional mores of our society in a manner impossible to quantify. Such research tends to treat the human body as a commodity
\emdash a means to a profitable end. The dignity and sanctity with which we regard the human whole, body as well as mind and soul, are absent when we allow researchers to further their own interests without the patient\rquote s participatio
n by using a patient\rquote s cells as the basis for a marketable product.\'94 (Danforth, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 ,6 Yale L. & Pol\rquote y Rev.\~at p.\~

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [135] A second policy consideration adds notions of equity to those of ethics. Our society values fundamental fairness in 
dealings between its members, and condemns the unjust enrichment of any member at the expense of another. This is particularly true when, as here, the parties are not in equal bargaining positions. We are repeatedly told that the commercial products of th
e biotechnological revolution \'93hold the promise of tremendous profit.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Toward the Right of Commerciality}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507

211.)In the case at bar, for example, the complaint alleges that the market for the kinds of proteins produced by the Mo cell line was predicted to exceed $3 billion by 1990. These profits are currently shared exclusively between the
 biotechnology industry and the universities that support that industry. The profits are shared in a wide variety of ways, including \'93direct entrepreneurial ties to genetic-engineering firms\'94 and \'93
an equity interest in fledgling biotechnology firms\'94 (Howard, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , 44 Food Drug Cosm.L.J. at p.\~
338). Thus the complaint alleges that because of his development of the Mo cell line defendant Golde became a paid consultant of defendant Genetics Institute and acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of that firm\rquote s sto
ck at a cost of 1 cent each; that Genetics Institute further contracted to pay Golde and the Regents at least $330,000 over 3 years, including a pro rata share of Golde\rquote

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [136] There is, however, a third party to the biotechnology enterprise\emdash the patient who is the source of the blood or tissue from which all these profits are derived. While he may be 
a silent partner, his contribution to the venture is absolutely crucial: as pointed out above (pt.\~3, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 ), but for the cells of Moore\rquote

Thomas H. Murray, a respected professor of ethics and public policy, testified before Congress, \'93the person [who furnishes the tissue] should be justly compensated\'85
. If biotechnologists fail to make provision for a just sharing of profits with the person whose gift made it possible, the public\rquote s sense of justice will be offended and no one will be the winner.\'94 (Murray, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507

Recognizing a donor\rquote s property rights would prevent unjust enrichment by giving monetary rewards to the donor and researcher proportionate to the value of their respective contributions. Biotechnology depends upon the contributions of both 
patients and researchers. If not for the patient\rquote s contribution of cells with unique attributes, the medical value of the bioengineered cells would be negligible. But for the physician\rquote

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [139] The majority\rquote s second reason for declining to extend the conversion cause of action to the present context is that \'93the Legislature should make that decision.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
496 of 793 P.2d.) I do not doubt that the Legislature is competent to act on this topic. The fact that the Legislature may intervene if and when it chooses, however, does not in the meanwhile relieve the courts of their duty of enforcing\emdash 
or if need be, fashioning\emdash an effective judicial remedy for the wrong here alleged. As I observed above (pt.\~1, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
), if a conversion cause of action is otherwi
se an appropriate remedy on these facts we should not refrain from recognizing it merely because the Legislature has not yet addressed the question. To do so would be to abdicate pro tanto our responsibility over a body of law\emdash torts\emdash 
that is particularly a 
creature of the common law. And such reluctance to act would be especially unfortunate at the present time, when the rapid expansion of biotechnological science and industry makes resolution of these issues an increasingly pressing need.}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [140] The inference I draw from the current statutory regulation of human biological materials, moreover, is the opposite of that drawn by the majority. By selective quotation of the statutes (maj. opn., 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156, fns. 22 & 23 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~489, fns. 22 & 23 of 7
93 P.2d) the majority seem to suggest that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold on the open market\emdash 
thereby implying that if the Legislature were to act here it would impose a similar ban on monetary compensation for the use of human tissue in biot
echnological research and development. But if that is the argument, the premise is unsound: contrary to popular misconception, it is not true that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [141] As to organs, the majority rely on the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (Health & Saf.Code, \'a7
 7150 et seq., hereafter the UAGA) for the proposition that a competent adult may make a post mortem gift of any part of his body but may not receive \'93valuable consideration\'94 for the transfer. But the prohibition of the UAGA
 against the sale of a body part is much more limited than the majority recognize: by its terms (Health & Saf.Code, \'a7 7155, subd. (a)) the prohibition applies only to sales for \'93transplantation\'94 or \'93therapy.\'94
Yet a different section of the UAGA authorizes the transfer and receipt of body parts for such additional purposes as \'93medical or dental education, research, or advancement of medical or dental science.\'94(Health & Saf.Code, \'a7
 7153, subd. (a)(1).) No section of the UAGA prohibits anyone from selling body 
parts for any of those additional purposes; by clear implication, therefore, such sales are legal. Indeed, the fact that the UAGA prohibits no sales of organs other than sales for \'93transportation\'94 or \'93therapy\'94
 raises a further implication that it is also legal for anyone to sell human tissue to a biotechnology company for research and development purposes.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [142] With respect to the sale of human blood the matter is much simpler: there is in fact no prohibition against such sales. The majority rely (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156, fn. 23 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
489, fn. 23 of 793 P.2d) on Health and Safety Code section 1606, which provides in relevant part that the procurement and use of blood for transfusion \'93shall be construed to be, and is declared to be \'85 the rendition of a service \'85
 and shall not be construed to be, and is declared not to be, a sale\'85.\'94 There is less here, however, than meets the eye: the statute does }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 not}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
 mean that a person cannot sell his blood or, by implication, that his blood is not his property. \'93
While many jurisdictions have classified the transfer of blood or other human tissue as a service rather than a sale, this position does not conflict with the notion that human tissue is property.\'94 (Columbia Note, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

No State or Federal statute prohibits the sale of blood, plasma, semen, or other replenishing tissues if taken in non-vital amounts. Nevertheless, State laws usually characterize these paid transfers as the provision of services r
ather than the sale of a commodity\'85.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[143] The primary legal reason for characterizing these transactions as involving services rather than goods is to avoid liability for contaminated blood products under either general product liability principles or the [Uniform Commercial Code\rquote 
s] implied warranty provisions.\'94 (OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , at p.\~
76, fn. omitted.) The courts have repeatedly recognized that the foregoing is the real purpose of this harmless legal fiction. (See, e.g., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Hyland Therapeutics v. Superior Court}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 509, 220 Cal.Rptr. 590;}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Cramer v. Queen of Angels Hosp.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157

 (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 606, 109 Cal.Rptr. 132.) Thus despite the statute relied on by the majority,
 it is perfectly legal in this state for a person to sell his blood for transfusion or for any other purpose indeed, such sales are commonplace, particularly in the market for plasma. (See OTA Rep., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 
supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , at p.\~121.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [144] It follows that the statutes regulating the transfers of human organs and blood do not support the majority\rquote 
s refusal to recognize a conversion cause of action for commercial exploitation of human blood cells without consent. On the contrary, because such statutes treat both organs and b
lood as property that can legally be sold in a variety of circumstances, they impliedly support Moore\rquote 
s contention that his blood cells are likewise property for which he can and should receive compensation, and hence are protected by the law of conversion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [145] The majority\rquote s final reason for refusing to recognize a conversion cause of action on these facts is that \'93there is no pressing need\'94
 to do so because the complaint also states another cause of action that is assertedly adequate to the task (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~
163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~496 of 793 P.2d); that cause of action is \'93the breach of a fiduciary duty to disclose facts material to the patient\rquote s consent or, alternatively, \'85
 the performance of medical procedures without first having obtained the patient\rquote s informed consent\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 id.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  at p.\~
150 of 271 Cal.Rptr., at p.\~483 of 793 P.2d). Although last, this reason is not the majority\rquote s least; in fact, it underlies much of the opinion\rquote s discussion of the conversion cause of action, recurring like a leitmo
tiv throughout that discussion.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[146] The majority hold that a physician who intends to treat a patient in whom he has either a research interest or an economic interest is under a fiduciary duty to disclose such interest to the patient before treatment; t
hat his failure to do so may give rise to a nondisclosure cause of action; and that the complaint herein states such a cause of action at least against defendant Golde. I agree with that holding as far as it goes.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [147] I disagree, however, with the majority\rquote s further conclusion that in the present context a nondisclosure cause of action is an adequate\emdash in fact, a superior\emdash 
substitute for a conversion cause of action. In my view the nondisclosure cause of action falls short on at least three grounds.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [148] First, the majority reason that \'93enforcement of physicians\rquote  disclosure obligations\'94 will ensure patients\rquote  freedom of choice. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~164 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~497 of 793 P.2d.) The majority do not spell out how those obligations will be \'93enforced\'94
; but because they arise from judicial decision (the majority opinion herein) rather than from legislative or administrative enactment, we may infer that the obligations will primarily be enforced by the traditional judicial remedy of an action for damage
s for their breach. Thus the majority\rquote 
s theory apparently is that the threat of such an action will have a prophylactic effect: it will give physician-researchers incentive to disclose any conflicts of interest before treatment, and will thereby protect their patients\rquote 
 right to make an informed decision about what may be done with their body parts.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [149] The remedy is largely illusory. \'93[A]n action based on the physician\rquote s failure to disclose material information sounds in negligence. As a practical matter,
 however, it may be difficult to recover on this kind of negligence theory because the patient must prove a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 causal connection}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
 between his or her injury and the physician\rquote s failure to inform.\'94 (Martin & Lagod, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Biotechnology and the Commercial Use of Human Cells: Toward an Organic View of Life and Technology}{

the patient must show that if he or she had been informed of all pertinent information, he or she would have declined to consent to the procedure in question.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Ibid.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 ) As we explained in the seminal case of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Cobbs v. Grant}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 (1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 245, 104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1, \'93
There must be a causal relationship between the physician\rquote s failure to inform and the injury to the plaintiff. Such a causal connection arises only if it is established that had revelation been made consent to treatment would not have been given.
\'94}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [150] The second barrier to recovery is still higher, and is
 erected on the first: it is not even enough for the plaintiff to prove that he personally would have refused consent to the proposed treatment if he had been fully informed; he must also prove that in the same circumstances }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 no reasonably prudent person}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  would have given such consent. The purpose of this \'93objective\'94 standard is evident: \'93
Since at the time of trial the uncommunicated hazard has materialized, it would be surprising if the patient-plaintiff did not claim that had he been informed of the dangers
 he would have declined treatment. Subjectively he may believe so, with the 20/20 vision of hindsight, but we doubt that justice will be served by placing the physician in jeopardy of the patient\rquote 
s bitterness and disillusionment. Thus an objective test is preferable: i.e., what would a prudent person in the patient\rquote s position have decided if adequately informed of all significant perils.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0

\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [151] Even in an ordinary Cobbs-type action i
t may be difficult for a plaintiff to prove that no reasonably prudent person would have consented to the proposed treatment if the doctor had disclosed the particular risk of physical harm that ultimately caused the injury. (See, e.g., }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Morgenroth v. Pacific Medical Center, Inc.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  (1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 521, 534, 126 Cal.Rptr. 681 [affirming nonsuit in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid4943157 Cobbs}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 -type action on ground, inter alia, of lack of proof that plaintiff would have refused coronary arteriogram if he had been told of risk of stroke].) This is
 because in many cases the potential benefits of the treatment to the plaintiff clearly outweigh the undisclosed risk of harm. But that imbalance will be even greater in the kind of nondisclosure action that the majority now contemplate: here we deal not 
with a risk of physical injuries such as a stroke, but with the possibility that the doctor might later use some of the patient\rquote 
s cast-off tissue for scientific research or the development of commercial products. Few if any judges or juries are likely to be
lieve that disclosure of such a possibility of research or development would dissuade a reasonably prudent person from consenting to the treatment. For example, in the case at bar no trier of fact is likely to believe that if defendants had disclosed thei
r plans for using Moore\rquote s cells, no reasonably prudent person in Moore\rquote s position\emdash i.e., a leukemia patient suffering from a grossly enlarged spleen\emdash 
would have consented to the routine operation that saved or at least prolonged his life. Here, as in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Morgenroth}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ibid.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
), a motion for nonsuit for failure to prove proximate cause will end the matter. In this context, accordingly, the threat of suit on a nondisclosure cause of action is largely a paper tiger.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
[152] The second reason why the nondisclosure cause of action is inadequate for the task that the majority assign to it is that it fails to solve half the problem before us: it gives the patient only the right to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid4943157 refuse}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  consent, i.e., the right to prohibit the commercialization of his tissue; it does not give him the right to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 grant}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  consent to that commercialization on the condition that he share in its proceeds. \'93Even though good reasons exist to support informed consent 
with tissue commercialization, a disclosure requirement is only the first step toward full recognition of a patient\rquote 
s right to participate fully. Informed consent to commercialization, absent a right to share in the profits from such commercial development
, would only give patients a veto over their own exploitation. But recognition that the patient[s] [have] an ownership interest in their own tissues would give patients an affirmative right of participation. Then patients would be able to assume the role 
of equal partners with their physicians in commercial biotechnology research.\'94 (Howard, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 supra}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , 44 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. at p.\~344.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [153] Reversing the words of the old song, the nondisclosure cause of action thus accentuates the negative and eliminates the 
positive: the patient can say no, but he cannot say yes and expect to share in the proceeds of his contribution. Yet as explained above (pt.\~4, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157 ), there are sound reasons of ethics and equity to recognize the patient\rquote s right to participate in such bene
fits. The nondisclosure cause of action does not protect that right; to that extent, it is therefore not an adequate substitute for the conversion remedy, which does protect the right.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [154] Third, the nondisclosure cause of action fails to reach a major c
lass of potential defendants: all those who are outside the strict physician-patient relationship with the plaintiff. Thus the majority concede that here only defendant Golde, the treating physician, can be directly liable to Moore on a nondisclosure caus
e of action: \'93The Regents, Quan, Genetics Institute, and Sandoz are not physicians. In contrast to Golde, none of these defendants stood in a fiduciary relationship with Moore or had the duty to obtain Moore\rquote 
s informed consent to medical procedures.\'94 (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~153 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~
486 of 793 P.2d.) As to these defendants, the majority can offer Moore only a slim hope of recovery: if they are to be liable on a nondisclosure cause of action, say the majority, \'93it can only be on account of Golde\rquote 
s acts and on the basis of a recognized theory of secondary liability, such as respondeat superior.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 Ibid.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
) Although the majority decline to decide the question whether the secondary-liability allegations of the complaint are sufficient, they strongly imp
ly disapproval of those allegations. And the majority further note that the trial court has already ruled insufficient the allegations of agency as to the corporate defendants. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~154 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~487 of 793 P.2d.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [155] To the ex
tent that a plaintiff such as Moore is unable to plead or prove a satisfactory theory of secondary liability, the nondisclosure cause of action will thus be inadequate to reach a number of parties to the commercial exploitation of his tissue. Such parties
 
include, for example, any physician-researcher who is not personally treating the patient, any other researcher who is not a physician, any employer of the foregoing (or even of the treating physician), and any person or corporation thereafter participati
n
g in the commercial exploitation of the tissue. Yet some or all of those parties may well have participated more in, and profited more from, such exploitation than the particular physician with whom the plaintiff happened to have a formal doctor-patient r
elationship at the time.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [156] In sum, the nondisclosure cause of action (1) is unlikely to be successful in most cases, (2) fails to protect patients\rquote 
 rights to share in the proceeds of the commercial exploitation of their tissue, and (3) may allow the true exploiters to escape liability. It is thus not an adequate substitute, in my view, for the conversion cause of action.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [157] My respect for this court as an institution compels me to make one last point: I dissociate myself completely from the amateur bi
ology lecture that the majority impose on us throughout their opinion. (Maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , fns. 2, 29, 30, 33 and 35, and text at pp.\~157\endash

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [158] First, with the exception of defendants\rquote 
 patent none of the material in question is part of the record on appeal as defined by the California Rules of Court. Because this appeal is taken from a judgment of dismissal en
tered after the sustaining of general and special demurrers, there is virtually no record other than the pleadings. The case has never been tried, and hence there is no evidence whatever on the obscure medical topics on which the majority presume to instr
uct us. Instead, all the documents that the majority rely on for their medical explanations appear in an appendix to defendant Golde\rquote s opening brief on the merits. Such an appendix, however, is no more a part of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 record}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157  than the brief itself, because the
 record comprises only the materials before the trial court when it made its ruling. (See Cal.Rules of Court, rules 4 through 5.2.)Nor could Golde have moved to augment the record to include any of these documents, because none was \'93
part of the original superior court file,\'94 a prerequisite to such augmentation. (Cal.Rules of Court, rule 12(a).) \'93As a general rule, documents not before the trial court cannot be included as a part of the record on appeal.\'94 (}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [159] Second, most of these documents bear solely or primarily on the majority\rquote s discussion of whether Moore\rquote s \'93genetic material\'94 was or was not \'93unique\'94 (see maj. opn., }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , pp.\~157\endash 158 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp.\~490\endash 
491 of 793 P.2d), but that entire discussion is legally irrelevant to the present appeal. As Justice Broussard correctly observes in his separate opinion, \'93the question of uniqueness has no proper bearing on plaintiff\rquote s basic right to maintai
n a conversion action; ordinary property, as well as unique property, is, of course, protected against conversion.\'94 (Conc. and dis. opn. of Broussard, J., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid4943157 , p.\~170 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~503 of 793 P.2d.)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [160] Third, this nonissue is also a non-contention. The majority claim that \'93Moore relies \'85 primarily\'94 on an analogy to certain right-of-privacy decisions (maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 
\ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , p.\~156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p.\~489 of 793 P.2d), but this is not accurate. Under our rules, as in appellate practice generally, the pa
rties to an appeal are confined to the contentions raised in their briefs (see Cal.Rules of Court, rule 29.3). In his brief on the merits in this court Moore does not even cite, less still \'93rely primarily,\'94
 on the right-of-privacy decisions discussed by th
e majority, nor does he draw any analogy to the rule of those decisions. It is true that in the course of oral argument before this court, counsel for Moore briefly paraphrased the analogy argument that the majority now attribute to him; but a party may n
ot, of course, raise a new contention for the first time in oral argument.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [161] Fourth, much of the material that the majority rely on in this regard is written in highly technical scientific jargon by and for specialists in the field of contemporary molec
ular biology. (See, e.g., articles cited in maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 
, fn. 30, 2d par., & fn. 35, 2d par.) As far as I know, no member of this court is trained as a molecular biologist, or even as a physician; without expert testimony in the record, therefore, the m
ajority are not competent to explain these arcane points of medical science any more than a doctor would be competent to explain esoteric questions of the law of negotiable instruments or federal income taxation, or the rule against perpetuities.In attemp
t
ing to expound this science the majority run two serious risks. First, because they have no background in molecular biology the majority may simply misunderstand what they are reading, much as a layman might misunderstand a highly technical article in a p
rofessional legal journal. Indeed, I suggest the majority have already fallen into this very trap, since some of their explanations appear either mistaken, confused, or incomplete (e.g., maj. opn., }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid4943157 
ante}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 , fn. 29).}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [162] The second risk is that of omission. T
he majority have access to most of the legal literature published in this country; but even if the majority could understand the medical literature, as a practical matter they have access to virtually none of it. This is demonstrated by the fact that ever
y one of the medical articles now relied on by the majority came into their possession as reprints furnished to this court by one of the parties to this lawsuit\emdash 
obviously not an unbiased source. Because the majority are thus not equipped to independently re
search the medical points they seek to make, they risk presenting only one side of the story; it may well be that other researchers have reached different or even contrary results, reported in publications that defendants, acting in self-interest, have no
t furnished to the court. I leave it to professionals in molecular biology to say whether the majority\rquote s explanations on this topic are both correct and balanced. Because I fear they may be neither, I cannot subscribe to any of them.}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4943157 [163] I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal to direct the trial court to overrule the demurrers to the cause of action for conversion. \~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid4931781
