### Review

This week, we will continue to practice analyzing the patterns of common law argument that we began to develop in Week 2. Before getting into the material for this week, it is worth taking a moment to refresh your memory of the different [argument types](../week2/#argument-types) we worked to identify last week in *Harrison v Carswell*.

## Property in Your Cells ##

We will be using the same argument types from last week to practice analyzing the legal arguments in a case called *Moore v Regents of University of California*. This case addresses a very different set of facts and property issues than we found in *Harrison v Carswell*. In fact, it brings us back to the question I asked you the consider at the beginning of Week 1:

> *Should people continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed from their body?*

Recall that you listened to a [podcast on Henrietta Lacks](../week1/#property-in-your-cells). I then asked you to write down your answer to the question above and to identify the arguments you would use to support your answer.

In *Moore*, you will see how a common law court — here, the Supreme Court of California — answered this question about property in a person's cells. The plaintiff, Moore, sues his doctor and others in a cause of action called "conversion", essentially claiming that Moore's cells remain his property even after they have been removed from his body. In competing judgements, Justice Panelli and Justice Mosk offer alternative answers to our question.

We are coming back to the question of property in cells at this point because it invites you to reflect on what you have learned so far in the course about analyzing the structure of legal arguments. Most likely, you will see that your answer to the question and your reasons from Week 1 share some similarities with those of the Court in *Moore*, but also some important differences. Were your reasons from Week 1 the types of stereotypical legal arguments we would expect to see a court making in a case like *Moore*? Is your understanding of what counts as a valid "legal" argument starting to change?

### Spotting Arguments in *Moore*

As we did in Week 2 with *Harrison v Carswell*, we will spend time in class this week linking the argument bites and identifying the various argument types in *Moore*. A good way for you to prepare for class is to work through the judges' decisions and try to identify one example of each argument type in the exchanges between judges (there are one or more of each type in the case). As you do this, you might try to colour-code or highlight the argument bites you've identified, just as I did for you in *Harrison*. You can download the case as a text file in order to do this on your own computer ([RTF](/cases/moore.rtf) or [DOCX](/cases/moore.docx)).

Note that it is easiest to identify the different arguments bites in *Moore* using [Justice Mosk's decision](#mosk) because he conveniently enumerates each argument as he responds, point by point, to Justice Panelli. I suggest that you tackle the case as follows:

- start by reading Justice Panelli's description of the facts and the cause of action in conversion (paragraphs 1-13 and 35-38);

- continue to read the full judgement (Justices Panelli's and Mosk's decisions) to get a sense of the major disagreements in the case;

- go back through the case to spot argument types by using Justice Mosk's decision as a guide.

## Looking Ahead to Unit 2 ##

Having spent some time now developing a vocabulary to analyze common law arguments, you might be wondering how we can ever hope to know what the "correct" answer is to any question in property law. If argument bites always come in pairs — if we can always predict the stereotypical counter-argument to any legal argument — how does any party ever win out in court? How can this structure of argument ever help us to resolve legal disputes?

The answer to that question will occupy us for the remainder of our course this year. In Week 1, I introduced the idea that we can think about the structure of legal arguments at two levels by drawing an analogy to language: there is the level of legal vocabulary (the argument types we've been working with so far) and the deeper level of legal grammar and style. In Unit 2, we will begin to develop a historical understanding of this deeper structure of property law in Canada, starting with the doctrine of first possession.
