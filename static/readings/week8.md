So far in Unit 2 we have been focused on how classical legal thought addressed questions of possession and title. We now turn to a second prominent topic in the classical period—one that mainly addresses the *content* of property rights held by owners or those in possession. 

One right in particular, some argue, is fundamental to private property: the *right to exclude* others from interfering with the owner's use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. The common law has devised several remedies to enforce owners' right to exclude. We have already seen two examples in Unit 1. In *Harrison v Carswell*, the mall owner brought an action in *trespass* against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk, while the plaintiff in *Moore* made a claim in *conversion* in his attempt to exclude the defendants from using his cells after they were extracted from his body. Both of these are causes of action in tort designed to protect the right to exclude.

This week, we will look at a third type of tort action that engages owners' rights to exclude, but also—reciprocally—other owners' rights to use their property as they wish: an action in *nuisance*. I know that you are currently studying nuisance doctrine more fully in your torts class this term. Our focus here will be somewhat narrower. We will explore nuisance law as a "property tort" for what it can tell us about how judges in the mode of classical legal thought address the clash of private property rights between neighbours and to what extent courts were willing to enforce an owner's right to exclude. The material we cover will largely be distinct from—but mutually reinforcing with—the material you study in torts this term.

Our focus is on just one aspect of nuisance doctrine: the question of *remedy*. Once a nuisance has been established on the facts (as it is in all the cases we'll study in this course), should courts grant an injunction to prevent the nuisance-causing activity or should courts award damages to compensate the plaintiff for their losses? The former option most effectively enforces the owner's right to exclude, while the latter forces the owner to accept payment for an ongoing violation of that right.

### The Bundle of Sticks

{{< figure src="/media/sticks.jpg" caption="[Source: Wikimedia, Stephhzz - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11728347)" link="">}}

When trying to explain the common law's particular (and sometimes idiosyncratic) understanding of "ownership", lawyers and judges frequently invoke the "bundle of sticks" metaphor—as in, "ownership is like a bundle of sticks"—the "sticks" being the various property rights that make up the ownership "bundle". 

The idea behind the metaphor is that ownership is not really a uniform collection of rights that one either has (ownership) or does not (no ownership). Instead, ownership is a malleable legal concept, difficult to pin down to any particular arrangement or bundle. One landowner might have an unrestricted right to use their land in any way they like, while another might have certain use rights taken out of their ownership bundle—say, by public land use regulations restricting what they can build. We would likely call both an "owner", even though they hold different sets of legal entitlements. 

This "bundle" view of property of course raises the question: if stick after stick is eliminated from the ownership bundle, at what point does one cease to become an "owner" at all (recall that this was one of the fundamental disagreements between the judges in *Moore*)?

## Nuisance Law in an Industrializing Canada ##

{{< figure src="/media/canada_paper.jpg" caption="[Canada Paper Company, Windsor Mills, QC, 1909. Source: McCord Museum, Montreal.](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/VIEW-4677/)" link="">}}

Widespread industrialization came somewhat late in Canada compared to England and the United States, where nuisance law was earlier addressed in the common law courts as a potential impediment to economic "progress". As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:[^nedelsky1981]

> By the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.

Like their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became to what extent Canadian courts would follow these established precedents—primarily from England—or chart their own path.

On the question of what remedy the Canadian courts should apply in cases where a nuisance had been proved by the plaintiff, the English Court of Appeal's decision in *Shelfer v City of London Electrical Lighting Co.* loomed large. Traditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. In *Shelfer*, the Court opened the door for greater flexibility on the part of courts to substitute an award of damages in place of a permanent injunction in appropriate circumstances. Legal historians have largely interpreted this move as an attempt by the Court to take a more accommodating position toward industrial interests. 

The brief excerpt below from *Shelfer* reviews the key legal test on remedy in nuisance.

## Shelfer v City of London Electrical Lighting Co, [1895] 1 Ch 287 ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/shelfer.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/shelfer.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/shelfer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

[*The defendant in this case, the City of London Electric Lighting Company, operated large engines and other heavy machinery that caused damage to the foundations of a pub (the Waterman's Arms) leased by the plaintiff, Shelfer, as well as a lot of noise and other "annoyances". There was no issue of existence of the nuisance—the only issue before the course was what type of remedy should be available to the plaintiff.*]

*A. L. Smith LJ* — 

[1] I now come to the question whether, in a case like the present, to award damages in substitution for an injunction is, or is not, an altogether erroneous exercise of the jurisdiction given by the section. Mr. Justice Kekewich has found, and these findings are unappealed against, that the Defendants were, at the date of action brought, creating a continuing nuisance by means of vibration, noise, and steam which were produced by the working of their plant and machinery, whereby not only annoyance, in­ convenience, and personal discomfort were occasioned to the Plaintiff, his wife and daughter in the occupancy of their house, but the two latter had been, by the nuisance, made actually ill. There was also evidence that the Defendants, by the erection of their works, had let down the buildings of the Plaintiffs, which consequently cracked, and that the continuous vibration which subsequently arose from the user of their plant and machinery was constantly increasing and aggravating these cracks.

[2] It was proved that the Defendants were producing elec­tricity by means of engines of from 4000 to 5000 horse-power, and that unless stopped by injunction they were about to increase their engine power to not less than at least 20,000 horse­ power.

[3] It appears to me, to use the words in the judgment of the Court in Martin v. Price (1), to which I was a party, that "the plain­tiff’s legal right, and its infringement already, and threatened further infringement, to a material extent," has been established, and that "the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction according to the ordinary principles upon which the Court is in the habit of acting in these cases."

[4] Then what is there in this case to take it out of the ordinary rule?

[5] There is no suggestion of any conduct on the Plaintiff’s part depriving him of his prima facie right to an injunction.

[6] Then why is it that Mr. Justice Kekewich awarded damages in the place of an injunction? 

[7] The learned Judge appears to have thought that, because the Defendants at the trial had consented to abate the nuisance caused by steam, though not that caused by vibration and noise, damages were the proper remedy and adequate to compensate the Plaintiff. But I would point out that the learned Judge himself stated in his judgment that he was unable to allot to the different matters complained of the part each took in creating the undoubted nuisance proved to exist, and the reasons he gives for awarding damages are as follows: "Having regard to the occupation not having been as a matter of money interfered with, having regard also to this, that the inconvenience is felt very much more at one part of the house than the other, almost exclusively as regards a great part of the complaint in the upper floors, and having regard at any rate to the possibility of some inconvenience and probably some loss of accommodation, of making sleeping arrangements elsewhere, which I suppose is possible, haying regard also to the large inconvenience to say no more of stopping a business such as carried on by the Defen­ dants, I think this is a case in which damages are a very fair compensation."

[8] It is here that I cannot agree with the learned Judge. Be­ cause the Plaintiff does not suffer a money loss, and is only driven out of his upper floors, and has only to make arrange­ ments for sleeping elsewhere, he, according to the Judge, is not entitled to stop the continuance of the nuisance, but damages are a very fair compensation.

[9] Many Judges have stated, and I emphatically agree with them, that a person committing a wrongful act (whether it be a public company for public purposes or a private individual) is not thereby entitled to ask the Court to sanction his doing so by purchasing his neighbour’s rights, by assessing damages in that behalf, leaving his neighbour with the nuisance, or his lights dimmed, as the case may be.

[10] In such cases the well-known rule is not to accede to the application, but to grant the injunction sought, for the plaintiff’s legal right has been invaded, and he is *prima facie* entitled to an injunction.

[11] There are, however, cases in which this rule may be relaxed, and in which damages may be awarded in substitution for an injunction as authorized by this section.

[12] In any instance in which a case for an injunction has been made out, if the plaintiff by his acts or laches has disentitled himself to an injunction the Court may award damages in its place. So again, whether the case be for a mandatory injunction or to restrain a continuing nuisance, the appropriate remedy may be damages in lieu of an injunction, assuming a case for an injunction to be made out.

[13] In my opinion, it may be stated as a good working rule that —

1. If the injury to the plaintiff’s legal rights is small,

2. And is one which is capable of being estimated in money, 

3. And is one which can be adequately compensated by a
small money payment,

4. And the case is one in which it would be oppressive to the defendant to grant an injunction :—

then damages in substitution for an injunction may be given.

[14] There may also be cases in which, though the four above-mentioned requirements exist, the defendant by his conduct, as, for instance, hurrying up his buildings so as if possible to avoid an injunction, or otherwise acting with a reckless disregard to the plaintiff’s rights, has disentitled himself from asking that damages may be assessed in substitution for an injunction.

[15] It is impossible to lay down any rule as to what, under the differing circumstances of each case, constitutes either a small injury, or one that can be estimated in money, or what is a small money payment, or an adequate compensation, or what would be oppressive to the defendant. This must be left to the good sense of the tribunal which deals with each case as it comes up for adjudication. For instance, an injury to the plaintiff’s legal right to light to a window in a cottage represented by £15 might well be held to be not small but considerable; whereas a similar injury to a warehouse or other large building represented by ten times that amount might be held to be inconsiderable. Each case must be decided upon its own facts; but to escape the rule it must be brought within the exception. In the present case it appears to me that the injury to the Plaintiff is certainly not small, nor is it in my judgment capable of being estimated in money, or of being adequately compensated by a small money payment.

## Remedying Nuisance in the Classical Style ##

The English Court of Appeal's judgement in *Shelfer* left subsequent judicial decisions open to considerable uncertainty as to how to apply Lord Justice Smith's test and therefore the circumstances under which a landowner's right to exclude in nuisance would be strictly enforced or not.

The Canadian common law on remedy in nuisance in the early twentieth century thus offers a useful case study in how judges relied on the fundamental premises of the classical legal style to "resolve" what was in effect a highly indeterminate doctrine. In the two cases below — *Black v Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canada Paper Co. v Brown* — the judges are confronted with what looks like very similar facts: large-scale industrial pollution causing damage to close-by private landowners. And yet, the judges reach quite different conclusions on the question of remedy (although the parties in fact agree on the remedy in *Black v Canadian Copper Co.*, Justice Middleton nevertheless devotes substantial discussion to the issue). 

How do the judges in these two cases draw on the style of classical common law reasoning to reach their decisions? In what ways do the judges interpret some land uses as "natural" and other "unnatural" and what role does this framing play in the decisions? 

Are you persuaded that one case is correctly and the other wrongly decided? Are the decisions necessarily irreconcilable? 

## *Black v Canadian Copper Co.* (1917), Archives of Ontario, RG 80-6-0-22 ##
<a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/black.rtf" rel="noopener">RTF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/black.docx" rel="noopener">DOCX</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="/cases/black.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>

**Middleton J.** —

[1] A large number of actions were brought, and many others threatened against the Canadian Copper Company, for damages supposed to have been sustained from vapours contained in metallurgical smoke issuing from the roast beds and smelter stacks of that company at Copper Cliff, near Sudbury. A motion was made to consolidate these actions resulting in the choice of four cases which were to proceed and to be regarded as test actions, the others remaining in abeyance in the meantime.

[2] The actions chosen were:

1.	An action by J. F Black a florist having a greenhouse and number of small plots upon which market garden produce was grown

2. An action by Jos.  Belanger, a farmer, upon a somewhat larger scale than usual for this district, who had claims for damage done to two farms. 

3.	An action by Mona Taillifer, a woman who worked also upon two farms not at all comparable to Belanger's farms, and in a much humbler way. 

4. 	An action by the Sudbury Dairy Company, milk dealers, who have a farm upon which their dairy herd was pastured quite close to Copper Cliff.

[3] Two actions were also pending against the Mond Nickel Company and It was arranged that those should be dealt with at the same time.

[4] All evidence taken in the first four actions was to be available in any of them and so far as it might be of value in the actions against the Mond Company, but the parties to the actions against that Company were to give such further evidence as they might desire. Subsequently it was arranged that certain evidence taken in the Mond cases should be used in the Copper Company cases. The actions against the Mond Company are:

1. An action by Mr. Clary, a member of the bar, who practises at Sudbury and who owns a farm in the Township of Dill, some 12 miles away. 

2.  An action by a man named Ostroski and his wife who own a small farm near the town of Coniston, where the Mond smelter Is situated. Ostroski and his wife kept a boarding house for men employed at the Mond works and this farm was originally intended mainly to supply vegetables for use at their boarding house.

[5] In all these actions claims were originally made for an injunction but at different times this claim has been abandoned and now the cases resolve themselves mainly, if not altogether, into assessments of damages. The difficulty is to ascertain what damage, if any, has been done by the omission of the smoke vapours from the roast beds and smelter stacks. While the admission of counsel makes my task easy so far as the granting of an injunction is concerned, I may say that in view of all that has occurred, I should not have granted an injunction interfering with the carrying on of the works in question.

{{< spoiler text="Justice Middleton's Emphasis on Remedy" >}}As Justice Middleton explains in the paragraph above, the parties to this action actually agreed on the issue of remedy—damages, rather than an injunction, should be awarded. Much of the decision (which I have omitted) therefore concerns the quantum of damages to be awarded. What reasons do you think the parties had for agreeing to the form of remedy in this case?

Despite this agreement by the parties, Justice Middleton devotes considerable space in his judgement to why he thinks damages in lieu of an injunction are appropriate in this case. He is clearly aware of this as a live issue in the courts at the time, as well as the challenge of providing a clear rationale for choosing between one option or the other against the background of *Shelfer*. {{< /spoiler >}}

[6] Smelter smoke may, no doubt, be a nuisance, and in addition to being disagreeable it may cause injury to vegetation and in some circumstances I have no doubt an injunction ought to be granted. For reasons which will appear later, I am of the opinion that the mines cannot be operated without the production of smoke from the roast yards and smelters which contains very large quantities of sulphur dioxide.

[7] In each case it ultimately becomes a question of degree and in a much modified sense a question of the greatest good to the greatest number. I do not mean by this as I shall show that for the mere purpose of early producing metal of value the owner of a mine may sacrifice his neighbours, but I think there are circumstances in which it is impossible for the individual to so assert his individual rights as to inflict a substantial injury upon the whole community.

[8] The individual right must be tenderly consigned but if pressed too far, if the Courts are found impotent, the Legislature must intervene and the right of eminent domain must be asserted for the weal of the community as a whole.

[9] The nickel region at Sudbury is an area some 26 miles from south west to north east, 16 miles wide. The ore deposits are situated at the edge of this huge basin where the edges of a great eruptive sheet appear. The inside of the basin is filled with sedimentary rocks and it is surrounded by the ordinary archaean rocks of the district.

[10] The whole district (I speak of this mining region, not of the vastly larger judicial district concerning which evidence has been given in a way that might mislead) has been burned over many times and while originally there were, no doubt white pines of considerable size these have long since disappeared and the only forest growth Is that usually found in northern Ontario small jack pines, birch and poplar. Repeated fires have denuded this "second growth" time and again and the entire soil has disappeared from most of the rocky hills either by being burned by fires in the dry season or by the operation of wind and rain. So the country now consists of the bare rocks, "mountains," in local parlance, upon which a few trees of little value maintain a stunted existence and valleys between, some very narrow, which are level and more or less fertile. Many, if not most of these valleys are swamp or muskeg, and beaver meadow, few only are adapted for farming without drainage.

[11] In some of these valleys the soil found is remarkably fertile in others it is sour and hard to cultivate; much depends upon the natural drainage.

[12] Until minerals were found, this whole country remained a wilderness but when mines were opened up towns and  villages sprang up around the mines and farms began to be cultivated to supply the needs of the community.

[13] If the mines should be prevented from operating the community could not exist at all once close the mines the mining community would be at an end and farming would not long continue. Any capable farmer would find farms easier to operate and nearer general markets if the local market ceased.

[14] It is the consideration of this situation that induced the plaintiffs' counsel to abandon the claim originally made for an injunction.

[15] All this appealed to me, but there is also a further consideration that seemed to me even more important. Nickel is essential for many of the world's greatest industries; the metal is only found in a few places; it cannot be mined and placed upon the market without producing a nuisance and affecting, at most, a comparatively small area; those going into that area to farm have ( in almost all cases) gone there with their eyes open, seeking to avail themselves of a market in which abnormally high prices rule because of the demands created by those mines and their great distance from ordinary sources of supply.

[16] Some cases of hardship may exist but according to the statement of counsel the mining companies have always stood ready to purchase the holdings of any individual at a price far in excess of the value.

[17] In my view the Court ought not to destroy the mining industry even if a few farms are damaged or destroyed, but in all such cases compensation liberally ought to be awarded.

[18] The Court has now by statute discretion to refuse an injunction and to award damages in lieu thereof. In *Shelfer  v. City of London* (1895) 1 Ch. 287, working rules for the exercise of this discretion are laid down perhaps none apply to the case in hand but no such situation as that which exists here has been considered in any reported decision.

[19] Although the mines have been in operation for many years this is the first time in which actions have come to trial. The explanation given is that some arrangement for compensation has heretofore been made, but now claims have been made and adjustment seems impossible and the Courts have been resorted to and much evidence has been given with the view of having it ascertained how far the mines are answerable for the crop failures. The Company sets up that many of the things complained of are not the result of the smoke but are to be attributed to entirely other causes, and that the claims are grossly exaggerated.

[20] Much time and money has been expended in preparing for the defence of these actions and I have had throughout to be on my guard lest the plaintiffs should be found waging an unequal warfare, but the plaintiffs represent a large constituency and their case has been well looked after. The admission by the defendants of certain evidence has saved the expense incident to expert evidence and has brought before the Court the result of proceedings in other jurisdictions where similar situations have been faced.

[21] In addition to claims for damage to crops claims were made for permanent injury to the soil.

[22] As will be seen when the individual cases are discussed the amounts claimed in these test cases are large, but the totals claimed in all the suits must be a very large sum.

[23] In the fall of 1915, the Government took action and by an order in council reciting that lands in the vicinity of the roast beds of the Mond Company "cannot be considered fit for agriculture purposes" withdrew them from location or sale. Shortly thereafter another order in council was passed withdrawing all unpatented lands near the Canadian Copper Company's works. About the same time the Canadian Copper Company, obtained a new location some 15 miles from Copper Cliff, for its roast beds and all roasting since June of 1916 has been done upon the new beds.

[24] In 1916 the Mond Company adopted a new system by which all the heap roasting was done upon the beds in the winter season and only reduction of fine ore took place in their sintering machines during the season when crops were growing.

[25] The Copper Company does not use the sintering machine and with its much larger output cannot arrange to do the roasting during the winter months only.

[26] Both companies use blast furnaces for the further reduction of ore and production of matte and the Canadian Copper Company, also use reverberatory furnaces for the treatment of fine ore, these are not complained of.

**The Chief Justice**

[1] For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.

**Idington J.**

[2] The respondent as the owner of property acquired some years before the appellant, in conducting its business as the manufacturers of pulp and paper, had ventured upon methods complained of herein, and had built thereon for himself an expensive home and surrounded it with everything to make that home comfortable and enjoyable.

[3] Such a venture was prompted no doubt by the sentimental reasons that the property had been the home of his father and ancestors for a hundred years or more and was suitable for a summer residence.

[4] No matter, however, what his reasons were, as a matter of law he was entitled to reside there in comfort when and as he saw fit.

[5] The appellant for mere commercial reasons, disregarding the rights of respondent and all others, saw fit to introduce, in the conduct of its business, a process in the use of sulphate which produced malodorous fumes which polluted the air, which the respondent was as owner for himself and his family and guests fully entitled to enjoy in said home and on said property, to such an extent as to render them all exceedingly uncomfortable.

[6] The learned trial judge granted a perpetual injunction restraining the appellant from the use of such material in such a way as to produce such results.

[7] Upon appeal to the Court of King’s Bench in Quebec that court maintained said judgment and dismissed the appeal, the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Guerin dissenting.

[8] I cannot agree with the entire reasoning of those so dissenting.

[9] I agree with the learned Chief Justice when he seems to recognize that in principle the relevant law of England and Quebec are hardly distinguishable, but with great respect, I cannot follow his reasoning, much less that of his learned colleague, Mr. Justice Guerin, when attempting to give reasons which do not agree yet seem to me each to fall far short of protecting efficiently the rights of such an owner of property as appellant.

[10] The discomforts arising from the operation of a business such as a railway duly authorized by law must be endured. The discomforts arising from the mass of impurities that city smoke produces must also, often being long established conditions of such life, be endured.

[11] The legislative provisions made in France far in advance of anything we have in Canada dealing directly or indirectly with such a problem as presented herein and the opinion of commentators in light thereof and largely founded upon such light, cannot help us.

[12] Nor, I submit, can the very minor modifications thereof, relegating to the municipal authorities the power to prohibit, be held as at all effective.

[13] I cannot see why the power of a municipality to act, but which yet fails to act, can at all interfere with the rights of an owner to enjoy his property in the full sense thereof.

[14] The municipality is not given and, I respectfully submit, should not be given power to take away unless upon due compensation the rights of the owner to enjoy his property which carries with it pure air, light and pure water.

{{< spoiler text="A Mass of Irrelevant Evidence" >}}Why does Justice Idington think that so much evidence adduced in the case is "irrelevant"? What evidence is he referring to? {{< /spoiler >}}

[15] The argument, that because the exercise by appellant of powers it arrogates to itself but are non-existent in law, may conduce to the prosperity of the little town or village in which the appellants’ works are situated, seems to have led to a mass of irrelevant evidence being adduced, and as a result thereof the confusion of thought that produces the remarkable conclusion that because the prosperity of said town or village would be enhanced by the use of the new process therefore the respondent has no rights upon which to rest his rights of property.

[16] I cannot assent to any such mode of reasoning or that there exists in law any such basis for taking from any man his property and all or any part of what is implied therein.

[17] Yet upon some such possible basis the mass of evidence before us seems to have been presented.

[18] The invasion of rights incidental to the ownership of property, or the confiscation thereof, may suit the grasping tendencies of some and incidentally the needs or desires of the majority in any community benefiting thereby; yet such a basis or principle of action should be stoutly resisted by our courts, in answer to any such like demands or assertions of social right unless and until due compensation made by due process of law.

[19] Progress may be legislatively made in that direction by many means offering due compensation to the owners, but we must abide by the fundamental law as we find it until changed.

{{< spoiler text="The Question of Expropriation" >}}The issue of "due compensation" — or what we will next week call "expropriation" (i.e. the power of the state to take property in return for compensation) — seems to play a role here. What is that role? Why is it relevant to the determination of remedy in nuisance?  {{< /spoiler >}}

[20] And I cannot find that in France or Quebec any such legal theory as that argument rests upon has any foundation.

[21] In looking up authorities upon the question of injunction, such as this, I find in Kerr’s Law of Injunctions, 4th edition, at middle of page 155 and following, what I think expresses the right of the owner to an injunction such as in question.

[22] The history of that mode of remedy might require a volume, which I have no intention of writing, but to the curious I would commend the perusal of Story on Equity Jurisprudence, section 865 and following sections, as instructive of how in all probability the history of Quebec law, as also English equity jurisprudence, had its origin in regard to the assertion of a remedy by way of injunction.

[23] It is a most beneficial remedy and should not be weakened or emaciated merely because of preference of its development in one jurisdiction over that of another.

[24] I was, indeed, in considering this case and trying to find the relevant law, somewhat struck with a remark of V.C. Sir W. Page Wood, in the beginning of his judgment in the case of *Dent v. Auction Mart Co*. and other cases, that though the doctrine invoked had been established by Lord Eldon in *Attorney General v. Nichol*, and never had been departed from, that it was remarkable how few instances had occurred until ten or twelve years before 1866, when he was speaking, and within that short period how the number had increased.

[25] The wave, if I may so speak of progress, in way of applying any legal doctrine thus varies very much, but I must be permitted to think that the courts should be tenacious in the way of abiding by such a beneficent remedy as that by way of injunction.

[26] The case of *The Directors of St. Helen’s Smelting Co. v. Tipping*, in the House of Lords, is one of the landmarks, as it were in the modern English law on the subject, and the case of *Crossley & Sons, Ltd. v. Lightowler*, and cases cited therein, and the more recent case of *Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co*. may be found instructive as to the later development.

[27] I have not heard or read in factums presented here anything cited in conflict with the principles therein proceeded upon.

[28] Many early cases, and even late cases, can be found if one fails to take the principle of law involved as his guide rather than many decisions going off on special grounds which seem to conflict with said leading authorities.

[29] The subject is a very wide one and in many phases of its historical development do we find much that may not be worth considering because of the peculiar facts involved.

[30] And, I respectfully submit, that as long as we keep in view the essential merits of the remedy in the way of protecting the rights of property and preventing them from being invaded by mere autocratic assertions of what will be more conducive to the prosperity of the local community by disregarding such rights, we will not go far astray in taking as our guide the reasoning of any jurisprudence which recognizes the identical aim of protecting people in their rights of property when employing their remedy of perpetual injunction.

[31] I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.

[32] Nevertheless whilst strongly holding that, in cases such as this, the remedy by way of damages being inefficient and hence a basis for a perpetual injunction, yet, inasmuch as there may ere long be discovered by science or mechanical device, or both combined, a means of using sulphates in the process of manufacturing such as in question herein, there should have perhaps been expressed in the formal judgment a reservation entitling the appellant to apply to the court below for relief in such event, if meantime it has observed the injunction. 

[33] Let us hope that such an inducement may lead to resorting to science in a way that is not obvious in the evidence to which we were referred in argument.

**Duff J.**

[34] The respondent has established that the enjoyment of his property as a dwelling house is prejudicially affected in a substantial degree and in a degree which entitles him to invoke the protection of the court against the injurious consequences of the manufacturing operations of the appellant company who are clearly chargeable as for a *quasi-delit* within Art. 1053 of the Civil Code.

[35] The substantial question for consideration is whether or not the respondent is entitled to the injunction which has been awarded him. There appear to be good reasons for thinking that the discontinuance of the appellant company’s operations would result in material loss and inconvenience to their employees and their families who would probably be obliged to leave the locality in which they live at present in order to find means of livelihood elsewhere. But I am not satisfied that this will be the necessary result of the relief granted to the respondent. Indeed my conclusion, after a perusal of the whole evidence, is that the cessation of the appellant company’s operations would be neither the necessary nor the probable result of that relief.

[36] I am far from accepting the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that considerations touching the effect of granting the injunction upon the residents of the neighbourhood and indeed upon the interests of the appellant company itself are not considerations properly to be taken into account in deciding the question whether or not the remedy by injunction should be accorded the plaintiff under the law of Quebec. The court in granting that remedy exercises a judicial discretion not, that is to say, an arbitrary choice or a choice based upon the personal views of the judge, but a discretion regulated in accordance with judicial principles as illustrated by the practice of the courts in giving and withholding the remedy. An injunction will not be granted where, having regard to all the circumstances, to grant it would be unjust; and the disparity between the advantage to the plaintiff to be gained by the granting of that remedy and the inconvenience and disadvantage which the defendant and others would suffer in consequence thereof may be a sufficient ground for refusing it. Where the injury to the plaintiff’s legal rights is small and is capable of being estimated in money, and can be adequately compensated by a money payment, and where on the other hand the restraining or mandatory order of the court, if made, would bear oppressively upon the defendant and upon innocent persons, then although the plaintiff has suffered and is suffering an injury in his legal rights the court may find and properly find in these circumstances a reason for declining to interfere by exercising its powers in *personam*. This is not, as was suggested in argument, equivalent to subjecting the plaintiff to a process of expropriation, it is merely applying the limitations and restrictions which the law imposes in relation to the pursuit of this particular form of remedy in order to prevent it becoming an instrument of injustice and oppression.

{{< spoiler text="Applying Shelfer" >}}In the paragraph above, Justice Duff appears to apply the test for remedy from *Shelfer*. Is Justice Duff's reasoning consistent with the classical style of common law thought? {{< /spoiler >}}

[37] These last mentioned considerations, however, are not those which govern the disposition of the present appeal; the respondent’s injury is substantial, is continuing, and there is no satisfactory ground for thinking that any kind of disproportionate injury to the appellant company or to others will ensue from putting into execution the remedy granted by the court below.

**Anglin J.**

[38] My impression at the close of the argument was that the findings of the learned trial judge, — affirmed in appeal, — that the odours and gases emitted from the defendant’s sulphate plant were so extremely offensive to the senses that they “caused sensible discomfort and annoyance” to the plaintiff and his family, diminished the comfort and value of the plaintiff’s property and “materially interfered with the ordinary comfort of existence in the plaintiff’s said home”; and that

> the plaintiff cannot be adequately compensated in damages for the deprivation of the useful enjoyment of his property by the nuisance created and maintained by the said defendant —

were well warranted. Subsequent consideration of the evidence has only served to convert that impression into a firm conviction. To these findings, moreover, I would add another. The evidence has also satisfied me that sulphate soda pulp can readily be purchased by the defendants, or, if they should prefer to take that course, can be made by them at some other place, — for instance at or near to their pulpwood limits — where its production will be innocuous. The manufacture of sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not at all essential to the defendants’ continuing to produce there the classes and grades of paper for the making of which they now use such pulp prepared by a process in which sulphate of soda, salt or nitrate cake is an important ingredient.

[39] As Mr. Justice Flynn points out, it is common ground that science has been unable to indicate any means whereby the emanation and diffusion of these highly objectionable gases and odours in the manufacture of sulphate pulp can be obviated.

[40] The proposition that the existence of the state of affairs so found by the trial judge implies an invasion by the defendants of the plaintiff’s right of enjoyment of his property, likely to be persistent, far in excess of anything justifiable under *les droits de voisinage*, and amounting to an actionable wrong entitling him to relief in a court of law and justice scarcely calls for the citation of authority. But, if authority be required, it may be found in abundance in the able judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Flynn and in the factum and memorandum of authorities filed by the respondent.

[41] The power to grant an injunction is broad. Arts. 957, 968, C.P.C. I cannot think that, under such circumstances as the evidence here discloses, the court is restricted to giving such inadequate and unsatisfactory relief as the awarding of damages. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, Nos. 215-225, notably 224; 2 Aubry et Rau (5 ed.) p. 305. See too *Wood v. Conway*; *Adams v. Ursell*. Subject, therefore, to consideration of the several objections to that course taken in the dissenting opinions of the Chief Justice of Quebec and Mr. Justice Guerin, I should be disposed to agree with the learned judges who composed the majority of the Court of King’s Bench (Flynn, Tellier and Howard JJ.) that the injunction granted in the Superior Court should be upheld.

[42] Three difficulties are suggested by the learned Chief Justice: (1) The nuisance created is public and the right to suppress it belongs to the municipal authority under the R.S.Q. Arts. 5639 (14) and 5683 and not to the courts at the instance of a private property owner affected thereby: (2) It is in the interest of the great majority of the inhabitants of Windsor Mills that the operations of the defendant should not be interfered with; balance of convenience therefore requires that the injunction should be dissolved: (3) The injunction sought is not susceptible of enforcement without personal constraint of the defendants’ officials.

[43] Mr. Justice Guerin’s view is that the injunction is too radical and too heroic a remedy under the circumstances, viz. the impossibility of operating the sulphate process without emitting the odors and gases complained of, and the non-interference of the municipal authorities — and that damages would be the appropriate legal remedy.

{{< spoiler text="The Issue of Public Nuisance" >}}In the following paragraph, Justice Anglin addresses a question that arose in the Court of Appeal but is not addressed by the other judges at the Supreme Court. This is the issue of "public nuisance".

Here, the essential argument by the defendant is that the plaintiff's claim is in the nature of a "public" rather than "private" nuisance. Defendants to nuisance in some past cases had successfully argued that because certain activities impacted the public at large rather than one landowner specifically or uniquely, those activities could only be prosecuted by the Attorney General in the public interest—private actions in nuisance were barred in these circumstances. Such cases came to be known as causes of action in "public nuisance".

Does Justice Anglin accept the argument of public nuisance in this case? What can the structure of such a claim tell us about reasoning in the classical style?{{< /spoiler >}}

[44] The nuisance caused by the defendants no doubt affects the entire neighbouring population and other persons who have occasion to come within the sphere of its annoyance. But the injury to the plaintiff’s property is different in kind from the inconvenience suffered by the inhabitants at large — most of whom, moreover, are so dependent upon the operation of the defendants’ mills for their support that they are quite prepared to submit to some personal annoyance rather than jeopardize their means of livelihood. The inaction of the municipal authorities is no doubt ascribable to similar influences. By the nuisance of which he complains the plaintiff’s property is practically rendered uninhabitable and useless for the purposes for which he holds it. In my opinion he suffers an injury sufficiently distinct in character from that common to the inhabitants at large to warrant his maintaining this action. *Adami v. City of Montreal*; *Barthélémy c. Sénès*; *Derosne c. Puzin et al*; *Polsue & Alfieri, Ltd. v. Rushmer*; *Francklyn v. Peoples Heat & Light Co.*; Joyce on Nuisances s. 14. The fact that the making of soda-sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not essential to the manufacture of the products which the defendant’s mills turn out is an answer to the objection based on balance of convenience — if indeed mere balance of convenience would be a sufficient ground under the civil law of Quebec for refusing to enjoin the use of a process which necessarily entails an unjustifiable invasion of the plaintiff’s legal right to the enjoyment of his property. Art. 1065 C.C.; Fuz. Herman, Code Annoté, Art. 544, Nos. 3 & 39; ibid. Arts. 1382-3, Nos. 105, 109, 244 bis; 16 Laurent, No. 199; 24 Demolombe, Nos. 503-5; *Décarie et vir v. Lyall & Sons*.

[45] I am of the opinion that the power of the Quebec Courts to punish for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.) affords a means of enforcing their orders which sufficiently answers the suggestion that the injunction granted cannot be executed and is therefore obnoxious to Art. 541 C.P.C. In France while the court will enjoin the defendant from doing that which he is under obligation not to do, it has not the means of enforcement of the order available under English law and in Quebec by process of punishment for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.; See Art. 1033m. added to old Code of Procedure by 41 V. c. 14 s. 12; Art. 5991, R.S.Q. 1888). In France, the court can award damages in advance for refusal to obey, either in a lump sum or *toties quoties*, but not as a means of constraint or of indirect compulsion. D. 82, 2, 81; S. 1897. 2. 9, 12; 3 Garsonnet, Procédure, No. 528; 24 Demolombe No. 491; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens No. 224, n. 3. France has no provision similar to Art. 971 C.C.P. and the Art. 1142 C.N. is more restrictive than the initial clause of Art. 1065 C.C. Whatever they may have been theretofore, since the changes made in 1878, by 41 V. c. 14, the jurisdiction and practice of the Quebec courts in regard to the remedy of injunction would seem to resemble the jurisdiction and practice of English courts rather than of the courts of France. *Wills v. Central Ry. Co*. I  cannot assent to the third holding in *Lombard v. Varennes* as indicated in the head note. The arm of injunction would fail in one of its most useful applications if it should, on this ground, be held not to be available in a case such as that at bar. I am, with respect, satisfied that this objection rests on a mistaken conception of Art. 541 C.P.C.

[46] Nor is it possible to maintain that damages will afford an adequate remedy to the plaintiff. If he were confined to this method of redress he would, in effect, be forced to submit to partial expropriation of his property, as Mr. Justice Tellier suggests, without statutory authority for such an exercise of eminent domain.

[47] No delay was established such as might debar the plaintiff from a right to relief. *Francklyn v. People’s Heat & Light Co.*

[48] In my opinion the difficulties suggested to granting the plaintiff’s prayer for an injunction are more imaginary than real. I should be sorry indeed to think that this branch of the jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec is as restricted as counsel for the defendants contends.

[49] To confine the operation of the injunction to the periods of the year during which the plaintiff, his family or friends occupy the residence at Windsor Mills seems to be scarcely practicable. But there is no reason why liberty should not be reserved to the defendants to apply to be relieved from the inhibition if they can satisfy the Court that owing to scientific discovery sulphate pulp can and will be manufactured by them without interference with the plaintiff’s right to the enjoyment of his property.

[50] I would dismiss the appeal.
